2","content":"cud. The two cart-horses, Boxer and Clover, came in together, walking  very slowly and setting down their vast hairy hoofs with great care lest  there should be some small animal concealed in the straw. Clover was a  stout motherly mare approaching middle life, who had never quite got  her figure back after her fourth foal. Boxer was an enormous beast,  nearly eighteen hands high, and as strong as any two ordinary horses  put together. A white stripe down his nose gave him a somewhat stupid  appearance, and in fact he was not of first-rate intelligence, but he was  universally respected for his steadiness of character and tremendous  powers of work. After the horses came Muriel, the white goat, and  Benjamin, the donkey. Benjamin was the oldest animal on the farm,  and the worst tempered. He seldom talked, and when he did, it was  usually to make some cynical remark-for instance, he would say that  God had given him a tail to keep the flies off, but that he would sooner  have had no tail and no flies. Alone among the animals on the farm he  never laughed. If asked why, he would say that he saw nothing to laugh  at. Nevertheless, without openly admitting it, he was devoted to Boxer;  the two of them usually spent their Sundays together in the small  paddock beyond the orchard, grazing side by side and never speaking.  The two horses had just lain down when a brood of ducklings, which  had lost their mother, filed into the barn, cheeping feebly and  wandering from side to side to find some place where they would not  be trodden on. Clover made a sort of wall round them with her great  foreleg, and the ducklings nestled down inside it and promptly fell  asleep. At the last moment Mollie, the foolish, pretty white mare who  drew Mr. Jones's trap, came mincing daintily in, chewing at a lump of  sugar. She took a place near the front and began flirting her white  mane, hoping to draw attention to the red ribbons it was plaited with.  Last of all came the cat, who looked round, as usual, for the warmest  place, and finally squeezed herself in between Boxer and Clover; there  she purred contentedly throughout Major's speech without listening to a  word of what he was saying.  All the animals were now present except Moses, the tame raven, who  slept on a perch behind the back door. When Major saw that they had  all made themselves comfortable and were waiting attentively, he  cleared his throat and began:  \"Comrades, you have heard already about the strange dream that I had  last night. But I will come to the dream later. I have something else to  say first.

3","content":"months longer, and before I die, I feel it my duty to pass on to you such  wisdom as I have acquired. I have had a long life, I have had much time  for thought as I lay alone in my stall, and I think I may say that I  understand the nature of life on this earth as well as any animal now  living. It is about this that I wish to speak to you.  \"Now, comrades, what is the nature of this life of ours? Let us face it:  our lives are miserable, laborious, and short. We are born, we are given  just so much food as will keep the breath in our bodies, and those of us  who are capable of it are forced to work to the last atom of our strength;  and the very instant that our usefulness has come to an end we are  slaughtered with hideous cruelty. No animal in England knows the  meaning of happiness or leisure after he is a year old. No animal in  England is free. The life of an animal is misery and slavery: that is the  plain truth.  \"But is this simply part of the order of nature? Is it because this land of  ours is so poor that it cannot afford a decent life to those who dwell  upon it? No, comrades, a thousand times no! The soil of England is  fertile, its climate is good, it is capable of affording food in abundance  to an enormously greater number of animals than now inhabit it. This  single farm of ours would support a dozen horses, twenty cows,  hundreds of sheep-and all of them living in a comfort and a dignity that  are now almost beyond our imagining. Why then do we continue in this  miserable condition? Because nearly the whole of the produce of our  labour is stolen from us by human beings. There, comrades, is the  answer to all our problems. It is summed up in a single word-Man. Man  is the only real enemy we have. Remove Man from the scene, and the  root cause of hunger and overwork is abolished for ever.  \"Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does  not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough,  he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits. Yet he is lord of all the  animals. He sets them to work, he gives back to them the bare  minimum that will prevent them from starving, and the rest he keeps  for himself. Our labour tills the soil, our dung fertilises it, and yet there  is not one of us that owns more than his bare skin. You cows that I see  before me, how many thousands of gallons of milk have you given  during this last year? And what has happened to that milk which should  have been breeding up sturdy calves?

The rest have all gone to market to bring in money for Jones  and his men. And you, Clover, where are those four foals you bore,  who should have been the support and pleasure of your old age? Each  was sold at a year old-you will never see one of them again. In return  for your four confinements and all your labour in the fields, what have  you ever had except your bare rations and a stall?  \"And even the miserable lives we lead are not allowed to reach their  natural span. For myself I do not grumble, for I am one of the lucky  ones. I am twelve years old and have had over four hundred children.  Such is the natural life of a pig. But no animal escapes the cruel knife in  the end. You young porkers who are sitting in front of me, every one of  you will scream your lives out at the block within a year. To that horror  we all must come-cows, pigs, hens, sheep, everyone. Even the horses  and the dogs have no better fate. You, Boxer, the very day that those  great muscles of yours lose their power, Jones will sell you to the  knacker, who will cut your throat and boil you down for the foxhounds.  As for the dogs, when they grow old and toothless, Jones ties a brick  round their necks and drowns them in the nearest pond.  \"Is it not crystal clear, then, comrades, that all the evils of this life of  ours spring from the tyranny of human beings? Only get rid of Man,  and the produce of our labour would be our own. A1most overnight we  could become rich and free. What then must we do? Why, work night  and day, body and soul, for the overthrow of the human race! That is  my message to you, comrades: Rebellion! I do not know when that  Rebellion will come, it might be in a week or in a hundred years, but I  know, as surely as I see this straw beneath my feet, that sooner or later  justice will be done. Fix your eyes on that, comrades, throughout the  short remainder of your lives! And above all, pass on this message of  mine to those who come after you, so that future generations shall carry  on the struggle until it is victorious.  \"And remember, comrades, your resolution must never falter. No  argument must lead you astray. Never listen when they tell you that  Man and the animals have a common interest, that the prosperity of the  one is the prosperity of the others. It is all lies. Man serves the interests  of no creature except himself. And among us animals let there be  perfect unity, perfect comradeship in the struggle. All men are enemies.

The dogs had suddenly caught sight  of them, and it was only by a swift dash for their holes that the rats  saved their lives. Major raised his trotter for silence.  \"Comrades,\" he said, \"here is a point that must be settled. The wild  creatures, such as rats and rabbits-are they our friends or our enemies?  Let us put it to the vote. I propose this question to the meeting: Are rats  comrades?\"  The vote was taken at once, and it was agreed by an overwhelming  majority that rats were comrades. There were only four dissentients, the  three dogs and the cat, who was afterwards discovered to have voted on  both sides. Major continued:  \"I have little more to say. I merely repeat, remember always your duty  of enmity towards Man and all his ways. Whatever goes upon two legs  is an enemy. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.  And remember also that in fighting against Man, we must not come to  resemble him. Even when you have conquered him, do not adopt his  vices. No animal must ever live in a house, or sleep in a bed, or wear  clothes, or drink alcohol, or smoke tobacco, or touch money, or engage  in trade. All the habits of Man are evil. And, above all, no animal must  ever tyrannise over his own kind. Weak or strong, clever or simple, we  are all brothers. No animal must ever kill any other animal. All animals  are equal.  \"And now, comrades, I will tell you about my dream of last night. I  cannot describe that dream to you. It was a dream of the earth as it will  be when Man has vanished. But it reminded me of something that I had  long forgotten. Many years ago, when I was a little pig, my mother and  the other sows used to sing an old song of which they knew only the  tune and the first three words. I had known that tune in my infancy, but  it had long since passed out of my mind. Last night, however, it came  back to me in my dream. And what is more, the words of the song also  came back-words, I am certain, which were sung by the animals of long  ago and have been lost to memory for generations. I will sing you that  song now, comrades. I am old and my voice is hoarse, but when I have  taught you the tune, you can sing it better for yourselves. It is called  Beasts of England.\"  Old Major cleared his throat and began to sing.

Major's speech had given to the more intelligent animals  on the farm a completely new outlook on life. They did not know when  the Rebellion predicted by Major would take place, they had no reason  for thinking that it would be within their own lifetime, but they saw  clearly that it was their duty to prepare for it. The work of teaching and  organising the others fell naturally upon the pigs, who were generally  recognised as being the cleverest of the animals. Pre-eminent among  the pigs were two young boars named Snowball and Napoleon, whom  Mr. Jones was breeding up for sale. Napoleon was a large, rather  fierce-looking Berkshire boar, the only Berkshire on the farm, not much  of a talker, but with a reputation for getting his own way. Snowball was  a more vivacious pig than Napoleon, quicker in speech and more  inventive, but was not considered to have the same depth of character.  All the other male pigs on the farm were porkers. The best known  among them was a small fat pig named Squealer, with very round  cheeks, twinkling eyes, nimble movements, and a shrill voice. He was a  brilliant talker, and when he was arguing some difficult point he had a  way of skipping from side to side and whisking his tail which was  somehow very persuasive. The others said of Squealer that he could  turn black into white.  These three had elaborated old Major's teachings into a complete  system of thought, to which they gave the name of Animalism. Several  nights a week, after Mr. Jones was asleep, they held secret meetings in  the barn and expounded the principles of Animalism to the others. At  the beginning they met with much stupidity and apathy. Some of the  animals talked of the duty of loyalty to Mr. Jones, whom they referred  to as \"Master,\" or made elementary remarks such as \"Mr. Jones feeds  us. If he were gone, we should starve to death.\" Others asked such  questions as \"Why should we care what happens after we are dead?\" or  \"If this Rebellion is to happen anyway, what difference does it make  whether we work for it or not?\", and the pigs had great difficulty in  making them see that this was contrary to the spirit of Animalism. The  stupidest questions of all were asked by Mollie, the white mare. The  very first question she asked Snowball was: \"Will there still be sugar  after the Rebellion?\"  \"No,\" said Snowball firmly. \"We have no means of making sugar on  this farm.

Can you not understand that liberty is worth  more than ribbons? \"  Mollie agreed, but she did not sound very convinced.  The pigs had an even harder struggle to counteract the lies put about by  Moses, the tame raven. Moses, who was Mr. Jones's especial pet, was a  spy and a tale-bearer, but he was also a clever talker. He claimed to  know of the existence of a mysterious country called Sugarcandy  Mountain, to which all animals went when they died. It was situated  somewhere up in the sky, a little distance beyond the clouds, Moses  said. In Sugarcandy Mountain it was Sunday seven days a week, clover  was in season all the year round, and lump sugar and linseed cake grew  on the hedges. The animals hated Moses because he told tales and did  no work, but some of them believed in Sugarcandy Mountain, and the  pigs had to argue very hard to persuade them that there was no such  place.  Their most faithful disciples were the two cart-horses, Boxer and  Clover. These two had great difficulty in thinking anything out for  themselves, but having once accepted the pigs as their teachers, they  absorbed everything that they were told, and passed it on to the other  animals by simple arguments. They were unfailing in their attendance  at the secret meetings in the barn, and led the singing of Beasts of  England, with which the meetings always ended.  Now, as it turned out, the Rebellion was achieved much earlier and  more easily than anyone had expected. In past years Mr. Jones,  although a hard master, had been a capable farmer, but of late he had  fallen on evil days. He had become much disheartened after losing  money in a lawsuit, and had taken to drinking more than was good for  him. For whole days at a time he would lounge in his Windsor chair in  the kitchen, reading the newspapers, drinking, and occasionally feeding  Moses on crusts of bread soaked in beer. His men were idle and  dishonest, the fields were full of weeds, the buildings wanted roofing,  the hedges were neglected, and the animals were underfed.  June came and the hay was almost ready for cutting.

10","content":"The men had milked the cows in the early morning and then had gone  out rabbiting, without bothering to feed the animals. When Mr. Jones  got back he immediately went to sleep on the drawing-room sofa with  the News of the World over his face, so that when evening came, the  animals were still unfed. At last they could stand it no longer. One of  the cows broke in the door of the store-shed with her horn and all the  animals began to help themselves from the bins. It was just then that  Mr. Jones woke up. The next moment he and his four men were in the  store-shed with whips in their hands, lashing out in all directions. This  was more than the hungry animals could bear. With one accord, though  nothing of the kind had been planned beforehand, they flung  themselves upon their tormentors. Jones and his men suddenly found  themselves being butted and kicked from all sides. The situation was  quite out of their control. They had never seen animals behave like this  before, and this sudden uprising of creatures whom they were used to  thrashing and maltreating just as they chose, frightened them almost out  of their wits. After only a moment or two they gave up trying to defend  themselves and took to their heels. A minute later all five of them were  in full flight down the cart-track that led to the main road, with the  animals pursuing them in triumph.  Mrs. Jones looked out of the bedroom window, saw what was  happening, hurriedly flung a few possessions into a carpet bag, and  slipped out of the farm by another way. Moses sprang off his perch and  flapped after her, croaking loudly. Meanwhile the animals had chased  Jones and his men out on to the road and slammed the five-barred gate  behind them. And so, almost before they knew what was happening, the  Rebellion had been successfully carried through: Jones was expelled,  and the Manor Farm was theirs.  For the first few minutes the animals could hardly believe in their good  fortune. Their first act was to gallop in a body right round the  boundaries of the farm, as though to make quite sure that no human  being was hiding anywhere upon it; then they raced back to the farm  buildings to wipe out the last traces of Jones's hated reign. The  harness-room at the end of the stables was broken open; the bits, the  nose-rings, the dog-chains, the cruel knives with which Mr. Jones had  been used to castrate the pigs and lambs, were all flung down the well.  The reins, the halters, the blinkers, the degrading nosebags, were  thrown on to the rubbish fire which was burning in the yard. So were  the whips.

Snowball also threw on to the fire the ribbons with  which the horses' manes and tails had usually been decorated on market  days.  \"Ribbons,\" he said, \"should be considered as clothes, which are the  mark of a human being. All animals should go naked.\"  When Boxer heard this he fetched the small straw hat which he wore in  summer to keep the flies out of his ears, and flung it on to the fire with  the rest.  In a very little while the animals had destroyed everything that  reminded them of Mr. Jones. Napoleon then led them back to the  store-shed and served out a double ration of corn to everybody, with  two biscuits for each dog. Then they sang Beasts of England from end  to end seven times running, and after that they settled down for the  night and slept as they had never slept before.  But they woke at dawn as usual, and suddenly remembering the  glorious thing that had happened, they all raced out into the pasture  together. A little way down the pasture there was a knoll that  commanded a view of most of the farm. The animals rushed to the top  of it and gazed round them in the clear morning light. Yes, it was  theirs-everything that they could see was theirs! In the ecstasy of that  thought they gambolled round and round, they hurled themselves into  the air in great leaps of excitement. They rolled in the dew, they  cropped mouthfuls of the sweet summer grass, they kicked up clods of  the black earth and snuffed its rich scent. Then they made a tour of  inspection of the whole farm and surveyed with speechless admiration  the ploughland, the hayfield, the orchard, the pool, the spinney. It was  as though they had never seen these things before, and even now they  could hardly believe that it was all their own.  Then they filed back to the farm buildings and halted in silence outside  the door of the farmhouse. That was theirs too, but they were frightened  to go inside. After a moment, however, Snowball and Napoleon butted  the door open with their shoulders and the animals entered in single  file, walking with the utmost care for fear of disturbing anything. They  tiptoed from room to room, afraid to speak above a whisper and gazing  with a kind of awe at the unbelievable luxury, at the beds with their  feather mattresses, the looking-glasses, the horsehair sofa, the Brussels  carpet, the lithograph of Queen Victoria over the drawing-room  mantelpiece.

Going back, the others found that she had  remained behind in the best bedroom. She had taken a piece of blue  ribbon from Mrs. Jones's dressing-table, and was holding it against her  shoulder and admiring herself in the glass in a very foolish manner. The  others reproached her sharply, and they went outside. Some hams  hanging in the kitchen were taken out for burial, and the barrel of beer  in the scullery was stove in with a kick from Boxer's hoof,-otherwise  nothing in the house was touched. A unanimous resolution was passed  on the spot that the farmhouse should be preserved as a museum. All  were agreed that no animal must ever live there.  The animals had their breakfast, and then Snowball and Napoleon  called them together again.  \"Comrades,\" said Snowball, \"it is half-past six and we have a long day  before us. Today we begin the hay harvest. But there is another matter  that must be attended to first.\"  The pigs now revealed that during the past three months they had  taught themselves to read and write from an old spelling book which  had belonged to Mr. Jones's children and which had been thrown on the  rubbish heap. Napoleon sent for pots of black and white paint and led  the way down to the five-barred gate that gave on to the main road.  Then Snowball (for it was Snowball who was best at writing) took a  brush between the two knuckles of his trotter, painted out MANOR  FARM from the top bar of the gate and in its place painted ANIMAL  FARM. This was to be the name of the farm from now onwards. After  this they went back to the farm buildings, where Snowball and  Napoleon sent for a ladder which they caused to be set against the end  wall of the big barn. They explained that by their studies of the past  three months the pigs had succeeded in reducing the principles of  Animalism to Seven Commandments. These Seven Commandments  would now be inscribed on the wall; they would form an unalterable  law by which all the animals on Animal Farm must live for ever after.  With some difficulty (for it is not easy for a pig to balance himself on a  ladder) Snowball climbed up and set to work, with Squealer a few  rungs below him holding the paint-pot.

Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.  2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.  3. No animal shall wear clothes.  4. No animal shall sleep in a bed.  5.

Snowball read it aloud for the benefit of the others.  All the animals nodded in complete agreement, and the cleverer ones at  once began to learn the Commandments by heart.  \"Now, comrades,\" cried Snowball, throwing down the paint-brush, \"to  the hayfield!

But their efforts were  rewarded, for the harvest was an even bigger success than they had  hoped.  Sometimes the work was hard; the implements had been designed for  human beings and not for animals, and it was a great drawback that no  animal was able to use any tool that involved standing on his hind legs.  But the pigs were so clever that they could think of a way round every  difficulty. As for the horses, they knew every inch of the field, and in  fact understood the business of mowing and raking far better than Jones  and his men had ever done. The pigs did not actually work, but directed  and supervised the others. With their superior knowledge it was natural  that they should assume the leadership. Boxer and Clover would  harness themselves to the cutter or the horse-rake (no bits or reins were  needed in these days, of course) and tramp steadily round and round the  field with a pig walking behind and calling out \"Gee up, comrade!\" or  \"Whoa back, comrade!\" as the case might be. And every animal down  to the humblest worked at turning the hay and gathering it. Even the  ducks and hens toiled to and fro all day in the sun, carrying tiny wisps  of hay in their beaks. In the end they finished the harvest in two days'  less time than it had usually taken Jones and his men. Moreover, it was  the biggest harvest that the farm had ever seen. There was no wastage  whatever; the hens and ducks with their sharp eyes had gathered up the  very last stalk. And not an animal on the farm had stolen so much as a  mouthful.  All through that summer the work of the farm went like clockwork. The  animals were happy as they had never conceived it possible to be.  Every mouthful of food was an acute positive pleasure, now that it was  truly their own food, produced by themselves and for themselves, not  doled out to them by a grudging master. With the worthless parasitical  human beings gone, there was more for everyone to eat. There was  more leisure too, inexperienced though the animals were. They met  with many difficulties-for instance, later in the year, when they  harvested the corn, they had to tread it out in the ancient style and blow  away the chaff with their breath, since the

Boxer was the  admiration of everybody. He had been a hard worker even in Jones's  time, but now he seemed more like three horses than one; there were  days when the entire work of the farm seemed to rest on his mighty  shoulders. From morning to night he was pushing and pulling, always  at the spot where the work was hardest. He had made an arrangement  with one of the cockerels to call him in the mornings half an hour  earlier than anyone else, and would put in some volunteer labour at  whatever seemed to be most needed, before the regular day's work  began. His answer to every problem, every setback, was \"I will work  harder!\"-which he had adopted as his personal motto.  But everyone worked according to his capacity The hens and ducks, for  instance, saved five bushels of corn at the harvest by gathering up the  stray grains. Nobody stole, nobody grumbled over his rations, the  quarrelling and biting and jealousy which had been normal features of  life in the old days had almost disappeared. Nobody shirked-or almost  nobody. Mollie, it was true, was not good at getting up in the mornings,  and had a way of leaving work early on the ground that there was a  stone in her hoof. And the behaviour of the cat was somewhat peculiar.  It was soon noticed that when there was work to be done the cat could  never be found. She would vanish for hours on end, and then reappear  at meal-times, or in the evening after work was over, as though nothing  had happened. But she always made such excellent excuses, and purred  so affectionately, that it was impossible not to believe in her good  intentions. Old Benjamin, the donkey, seemed quite unchanged since  the Rebellion. He did his work in the same slow obstinate way as he  had done it in Jones's time, never shirking and never volunteering for  extra work either. About the Rebellion and its results he would express  no opinion. When asked whether he was not happier now that Jones  was gone, he would say only \"Donkeys live a long time. None of you  has ever seen a dead donkey,\" and the others had to be content with this  cryptic answer.  On Sundays there was no work. Breakfast was an hour later than usual,  and after breakfast there was a ceremony which was observed every  week without fail. First came the hoisting of the flag. Snowball had  found in the harness-room an old green tablecloth of Mrs. Jones's and  had painted on it a hoof and a horn in white.

been finally  overthrown. After the hoisting of the flag all the animals trooped into  the big barn for a general assembly which was known as the Meeting.  Here the work of the coming week was planned out and resolutions  were put forward and debated. It was always the pigs who put forward  the resolutions. The other animals understood how to vote, but could  never think of any resolutions of their own. Snowball and Napoleon  were by far the most active in the debates. But it was noticed that these  two were never in agreement: whatever suggestion either of them made,  the other could be counted on to oppose it. Even when it was resolved-a  thing no one could object to in itself-to set aside the small paddock  behind the orchard as a home of rest for animals who were past work,  there was a stormy debate over the correct retiring age for each class of  animal. The Meeting always ended with the singing of Beasts of  England, and the afternoon was given up to recreation.  The pigs had set aside the harness-room as a headquarters for  themselves. Here, in the evenings, they studied blacksmithing,  carpentering, and other necessary arts from books which they had  brought out of the farmhouse. Snowball also busied himself with  organising the other animals into what he called Animal Committees.  He was indefatigable at this. He formed the Egg Production Committee  for the hens, the Clean Tails League for the cows, the Wild Comrades'  Re-education Committee (the object of this was to tame the rats and  rabbits), the Whiter Wool Movement for the sheep, and various others,  besides instituting classes in reading and writing. On the whole, these  projects were a failure. The attempt to tame the wild creatures, for  instance, broke down almost immediately. They continued to behave  very much as before, and when treated with generosity, simply took  advantage of it. The cat joined the Re-education Committee and was  very active in it for some days. She was seen one day sitting on a roof  and talking to some sparrows who were just out of her reach. She was  telling them that all animals were now comrades and that any sparrow  who chose could come and perch on her paw; but the sparrows kept  their distance.  The reading and writing classes, however, were a great success. By the  autumn almost every animal on the farm was literate in some degree.

Muriel, the goat, could read  somewhat better than the dogs, and sometimes used to read to the  others in the evenings from scraps of newspaper which she found on  the rubbish heap. Benjamin could read as well as any pig, but never  exercised his faculty. So far as he knew, he said, there was nothing  worth reading. Clover learnt the whole alphabet, but could not put  words together. Boxer could not get beyond the letter D. He would  trace out A, B, C, D, in the dust with his great hoof, and then would  stand staring at the letters with his ears back, sometimes shaking his  forelock, trying with all his might to remember what came next and  never succeeding. On several occasions, indeed, he did learn E, F, G, H,  but by the time he knew them, it was always discovered that he had  forgotten A, B, C, and D. Finally he decided to be content with the first  four letters, and used to write them out once or twice every day to  refresh his memory. Mollie refused to learn any but the six letters  which spelt her own name. She would form these very neatly out of  pieces of twig, and would then decorate them with a flower or two and  walk round them admiring them.  None of the other animals on the farm could get further than the letter  A. It was also found that the stupider animals, such as the sheep, hens,  and ducks, were unable to learn the Seven Commandments by heart.  After much thought Snowball declared that the Seven Commandments  could in effect be reduced to a single maxim, namely: \"Four legs good,  two legs bad.\" This, he said, contained the essential principle of  Animalism. Whoever had thoroughly grasped it would be safe from  human influences. The birds at first objected, since it seemed to them  that they also had two legs, but Snowball proved to them that this was  not so.  \"A bird's wing, comrades,\" he said, \"is an organ of propulsion and not  of manipulation. It should therefore be regarded as a leg. The  distinguishing mark of man is the hand, the instrument with which he  does all his mischief.\"  The birds did not understand Snowball's long words, but they accepted  his explanation, and all the humbler animals set to work to learn the  new maxim by heart.

Four  legs good, two legs bad!\" and keep it up for hours on end, never  growing tired of it.  Napoleon took no interest in Snowball's committees. He said that the  education of the young was more important than anything that could be  done for those who were already grown up. It happened that Jessie and  Bluebell had both whelped soon after the hay harvest, giving birth  between them to nine sturdy puppies. As soon as they were weaned,  Napoleon took them away from their mothers, saying that he would  make himself responsible for their education. He took them up into a  loft which could only be reached by a ladder from the harness-room,  and there kept them in such seclusion that the rest of the farm soon  forgot their existence.  The mystery of where the milk went to was soon cleared up. It was  mixed every day into the pigs' mash. The early apples were now  ripening, and the grass of the orchard was littered with windfalls. The  animals had assumed as a matter of course that these would be shared  out equally; one day, however, the order went forth that all the  windfalls were to be collected and brought to the harness-room for the  use of the pigs. At this some of the other animals murmured, but it was  no use. All the pigs were in full agreement on this point, even Snowball  and Napoleon. Squealer was sent to make the necessary explanations to  the others.  \"Comrades!\" he cried. \"You do not imagine, I hope, that we pigs are  doing this in a spirit of selfishness and privilege? Many of us actually  dislike milk and apples. I dislike them myself. Our sole object in taking  these things is to preserve our health. Milk and apples (this has been  proved by Science, comrades) contain substances absolutely necessary  to the well-being of a pig. We pigs are brainworkers. The whole  management and organisation of this farm depend on us. Day and night  we are watching over your welfare. It is for your sake that we drink that  milk and eat those apples. Do you know what would happen if we pigs  failed in our duty? Jones would come back! Yes, Jones would come  back! Surely, comrades,\" cried Squealer almost pleadingly, skipping  from side to side and whisking his tail, \"surely there is no one among  you who wants to see Jones come back?\"  Now if there was one thing that the animals were completely certain of,  it was that they did not want Jones back.

The importance of keeping the pigs  in good health was all too obvious. So it was agreed without further  argument that the milk and the windfall apples (and also the main crop  of apples when they ripened) should be reserved for the pigs alone.  IV  BY THE late summer the news of what had happened on Animal Farm  had spread across half the county. Every day Snowball and Napoleon  sent out flights of pigeons whose instructions were to mingle with the  animals on neighbouring farms, tell them the story of the Rebellion,  and teach them the tune of Beasts of England.  Most of this time Mr. Jones had spent sitting in the taproom of the Red  Lion at Willingdon, complaining to anyone who would listen of the  monstrous injustice he had suffered in being turned out of his property  by a pack of good-for-nothing animals. The other farmers sympathised  in principle, but they did not at first give him much help. At heart, each  of them was secretly wondering whether he could not somehow turn  Jones's misfortune to his own advantage. It was lucky that the owners  of the two farms which adjoined Animal Farm were on permanently  bad terms. One of them, which was named Foxwood, was a large,  neglected, old-fashioned farm, much overgrown by woodland, with all  its pastures worn out and its hedges in a disgraceful condition. Its  owner, Mr. Pilkington, was an easy-going gentleman farmer who spent  most of his time in fishing or hunting according to the season. The  other farm, which was called Pinchfield, was smaller and better kept.  Its owner was a Mr. Frederick, a tough, shrewd man, perpetually  involved in lawsuits and with a name for driving hard bargains. These  two disliked each other so much that it was difficult for them to come  to any agreement, even in defence of their own interests.  Nevertheless, they were both thoroughly frightened by the rebellion on  Animal Farm, and very anxious to prevent their own animals from  learning too much about it. At first they pretended to laugh to scorn the  idea of animals managing a farm for themselves. The whole thing  would be over in a fortnight, they said.

When time passed and the animals had evidently not starved to death,  Frederick and Pilkington changed their tune and began to talk of the  terrible wickedness that now flourished on Animal Farm. It was given  out that the animals there practised cannibalism, tortured one another  with red-hot horseshoes, and had their females in common. This was  what came of rebelling against the laws of Nature, Frederick and  Pilkington said.  However, these stories were never fully believed. Rumours of a  wonderful farm, where the human beings had been turned out and the  animals managed their own affairs, continued to circulate in vague and  distorted forms, and throughout that year a wave of rebelliousness ran  through the countryside. Bulls which had always been tractable  suddenly turned savage, sheep broke down hedges and devoured the  clover, cows kicked the pail over, hunters refused their fences and shot  their riders on to the other side. Above all, the tune and even the words  of Beasts of England were known everywhere. It had spread with  astonishing speed. The human beings could not contain their rage when  they heard this song, though they pretended to think it merely  ridiculous. They could not understand, they said, how even animals  could bring themselves to sing such contemptible rubbish. Any animal  caught singing it was given a flogging on the spot. And yet the song  was irrepressible. The blackbirds whistled it in the hedges, the pigeons  cooed it in the elms, it got into the din of the smithies and the tune of  the church bells. And when the human beings listened to it, they  secretly trembled, hearing in it a prophecy of their future doom.  Early in October, when the corn was cut and stacked and some of it was  already threshed, a flight of pigeons came whirling through the air and  alighted in the yard of Animal Farm in the wildest excitement. Jones  and all his men, with half a dozen others from Foxwood and Pinchfield,  had entered the five-barred gate and were coming up the cart-track that  led to the farm. They were all carrying sticks, except Jones, who was  marching ahead with a gun in his hands. Obviously they were going to  attempt the recapture of the farm.  This had long been expected, and all preparations had been made.  Snowball, who had studied an old book of Julius Caesar's campaigns  which he had found in the farmhouse, was in charge of the defensive  operations.

21","content":"As the human beings approached the farm buildings, Snowball  launched his first attack. All the pigeons, to the number of thirty-five,  flew to and fro over the men's heads and muted upon them from  mid-air; and while the men were dealing with this, the geese, who had  been hiding behind the hedge, rushed out and pecked viciously at the  calves of their legs. However, this was only a light skirmishing  manoeuvre, intended to create a little disorder, and the men easily drove  the geese off with their sticks. Snowball now launched his second line  of attack. Muriel, Benjamin, and all the sheep, with Snowball at the  head of them, rushed forward and prodded and butted the men from  every side, while Benjamin turned around and lashed at them with his  small hoofs. But once again the men, with their sticks and their  hobnailed boots, were too strong for them; and suddenly, at a squeal  from Snowball, which was the signal for retreat, all the animals turned  and fled through the gateway into the yard.  The men gave a shout of triumph. They saw, as they imagined, their  enemies in flight, and they rushed after them in disorder. This was just  what Snowball had intended. As soon as they were well inside the yard,  the three horses, the three cows, and the rest of the pigs, who had been  lying in ambush in the cowshed, suddenly emerged in their rear, cutting  them off. Snowball now gave the signal for the charge. He himself  dashed straight for Jones. Jones saw him coming, raised his gun and  fired. The pellets scored bloody streaks along Snowball's back, and a  sheep dropped dead. Without halting for an instant, Snowball flung his  fifteen stone against Jones's legs. Jones was hurled into a pile of dung  and his gun flew out of his hands. But the most terrifying spectacle of  all was Boxer, rearing up on his hind legs and striking out with his  great iron-shod hoofs like a stallion. His very first blow took a  stable-lad from Foxwood on the skull and stretched him lifeless in the  mud. At the sight, several men dropped their sticks and tried to run.  Panic overtook them, and the next moment all the animals together  were chasing them round and round the yard. They were gored, kicked,  bitten, trampled on. There was not an animal on the farm that did not  take vengeance on them after his own fashion. Even the cat suddenly  leapt off a roof onto a cowman's shoulders and sank her claws in his  neck, at which he yelled horribly. At a moment when the opening was  clear, the men were glad enough to rush out of the yard and make a bolt  for the main road.

Back in the yard Boxer was pawing  with his hoof at the stable-lad who lay face down in the mud, trying to  turn him over. The boy did not stir.  \"He is dead,\" said Boxer sorrowfully. \"I had no intention of doing that.  I forgot that I was wearing iron shoes. Who will believe that I did not  do this on purpose?\"  \"No sentimentality, comrade!\" cried Snowball from whose wounds the  blood was still dripping. \"War is war. The only good human being is a  dead one.\"  \"I have no wish to take life, not even human life,\" repeated Boxer, and  his eyes were full of tears.  \"Where is Mollie?\" exclaimed somebody.  Mollie in fact was missing. For a moment there was great alarm; it was  feared that the men might have harmed her in some way, or even  carried her off with them. In the end, however, she was found hiding in  her stall with her head buried among the hay in the manger. She had  taken to flight as soon as the gun went off. And when the others came  back from looking for her, it was to find that the stable-lad, who in fact  was only stunned, had already recovered and made off.  The animals had now reassembled in the wildest excitement, each  recounting his own exploits in the battle at the top of his voice. An  impromptu celebration of the victory was held immediately. The flag  was run up and Beasts of England was sung a number of times, then the  sheep who had been killed was given a solemn funeral, a hawthorn  bush being planted on her grave. At the graveside Snowball made a  little speech, emphasising the need for all animals to be ready to die for  Animal Farm if need be.  The animals decided unanimously to create a military decoration,  \"Animal Hero, First Class,\" which was conferred there and then on  Snowball and Boxer. It consisted of a brass medal (they were really  some old horse-brasses which had been found in the harness-room), to  be worn on Sundays and holidays. There was also \"Animal Hero,  Second Class,\" which was conferred posthumously on the dead sheep.  There was much discussion as to what the battle should be called.

It was decided to set the gun up at the foot of the Flagstaff,  like a piece of artillery, and to fire it twice a year-once on October the  twelfth, the anniversary of the Battle of the Cowshed, and once on  Midsummer Day, the anniversary of the Rebellion.  V  AS WINTER drew on, Mollie became more and more troublesome.  She was late for work every morning and excused herself by saying that  she had overslept, and she complained of mysterious pains, although  her appetite was excellent. On every kind of pretext she would run  away from work and go to the drinking pool, where she would stand  foolishly gazing at her own reflection in the water. But there were also  rumours of something more serious. One day, as Mollie strolled  blithely into the yard, flirting her long tail and chewing at a stalk of  hay, Clover took her aside.  \"Mollie,\" she said, \"I have something very serious to say to you. This  morning I saw you looking over the hedge that divides Animal Farm  from Foxwood. One of Mr. Pilkington's men was standing on the other  side of the hedge. And-I was a long way away, but I am almost certain I  saw this-he was talking to you and you were allowing him to stroke  your nose. What does that mean, Mollie?\"  \"He didn't! I wasn't! It isn't true!\" cried Mollie, beginning to prance  about and paw the ground.  \"Mollie! Look me in the face. Do you give me your word of honour  that that man was not stroking your nose?\"  \"It isn't true!\" repeated Mollie, but she could not look Clover in the  face, and the next moment she took to her heels and galloped away into  the field.  A thought struck Clover. Without saying anything to the others, she  went to Mollie's stall and turned over the straw with her hoof.

24","content":"Three days later Mollie disappeared. For some weeks nothing was  known of her whereabouts, then the pigeons reported that they had seen  her on the other side of Willingdon. She was between the shafts of a  smart dogcart painted red and black, which was standing outside a  public-house. A fat red-faced man in check breeches and gaiters, who  looked like a publican, was stroking her nose and feeding her with  sugar. Her coat was newly clipped and she wore a scarlet ribbon round  her forelock. She appeared to be enjoying herself, so the pigeons said.  None of the animals ever mentioned Mollie again.  In January there came bitterly hard weather. The earth was like iron,  and nothing could be done in the fields. Many meetings were held in  the big barn, and the pigs occupied themselves with planning out the  work of the coming season. It had come to be accepted that the pigs,  who were manifestly cleverer than the other animals, should decide all  questions of farm policy, though their decisions had to be ratified by a  majority vote. This arrangement would have worked well enough if it  had not been for the disputes between Snowball and Napoleon. These  two disagreed at every point where disagreement was possible. If one  of them suggested sowing a bigger acreage with barley, the other was  certain to demand a bigger acreage of oats, and if one of them said that  such and such a field was just right for cabbages, the other would  declare that it was useless for anything except roots. Each had his own  following, and there were some violent debates. At the Meetings  Snowball often won over the majority by his brilliant speeches, but  Napoleon was better at canvassing support for himself in between  times. He was especially successful with the sheep. Of late the sheep  had taken to bleating \"Four legs good, two legs bad\" both in and out of  season, and they often interrupted the Meeting with this. It was noticed  that they were especially liable to break into \"Four legs good, two legs  bad\" at crucial moments in Snowball's speeches. Snowball had made a  close study of some back numbers of the Farmer and Stockbreeder  which he had found in the farmhouse, and was full of plans for  innovations and improvements. He talked learnedly about field drains,  silage, and basic slag, and had worked out a complicated scheme for all  the animals to drop their dung directly in the fields, at a different spot  every day, to save the labour of cartage. Napoleon produced no  schemes of his own, but said quietly that Snowball's would come to  nothing, and seemed to be biding his time.

25","content":"In the long pasture, not far from the farm buildings, there was a small  knoll which was the highest point on the farm. After surveying the  ground, Snowball declared that this was just the place for a windmill,  which could be made to operate a dynamo and supply the farm with  electrical power. This would light the stalls and warm them in winter,  and would also run a circular saw, a chaff-cutter, a mangel-slicer, and  an electric milking machine. The animals had never heard of anything  of this kind before (for the farm was an old-fashioned one and had only  the most primitive machinery), and they listened in astonishment while  Snowball conjured up pictures of fantastic machines which would do  their work for them while they grazed at their ease in the fields or  improved their minds with reading and conversation.  Within a few weeks Snowball's plans for the windmill were fully  worked out. The mechanical details came mostly from three books  which had belonged to Mr. Jones - One Thousand Useful Things to Do  About the House, Every Man His Own Bricklayer, and Electricity for  Beginners. Snowball used as his study a shed which had once been used  for incubators and had a smooth wooden floor, suitable for drawing on.  He was closeted there for hours at a time. With his books held open by  a stone, and with a piece of chalk gripped between the knuckles of his  trotter, he would move rapidly to and fro, drawing in line after line and  uttering little whimpers of excitement. Gradually the plans grew into a  complicated mass of cranks and cog-wheels, covering more than half  the floor, which the other animals found completely unintelligible but  very impressive. All of them came to look at Snowball's drawings at  least once a day. Even the hens and ducks came, and were at pains not  to tread on the chalk marks. Only Napoleon held aloof. He had declared  himself against the windmill from the start. One day, however, he  arrived unexpectedly to examine the plans. He walked heavily round  the shed, looked closely at every detail of the plans and snuffed at them  once or twice, then stood for a little while contemplating them out of  the corner of his eye; then suddenly he lifted his leg, urinated over the  plans, and walked out without uttering a word.  The whole farm was deeply divided on the subject of the windmill.  Snowball did not deny that to build it would be a difficult business.  Stone would have to be carried and built up into walls, then the sails  would have to be made and after that there would be need for dynamos  and cables.

26","content":"declared, so much labour would be saved that the animals would only  need to work three days a week. Napoleon, on the other hand, argued  that the great need of the moment was to increase food production, and  that if they wasted time on the windmill they would all starve to death.  The animals formed themselves into two factions under the slogan,  \"Vote for Snowball and the three-day week\" and \"Vote for Napoleon  and the full manger.\" Benjamin was the only animal who did not side  with either faction. He refused to believe either that food would become  more plentiful or that the windmill would save work. Windmill or no  windmill, he said, life would go on as it had always gone on-that is,  badly.  Apart from the disputes over the windmill, there was the question of the  defence of the farm. It was fully realised that though the human beings  had been defeated in the Battle of the Cowshed they might make  another and more determined attempt to recapture the farm and  reinstate Mr. Jones. They had all the more reason for doing so because  the news of their defeat had spread across the countryside and made the  animals on the neighbouring farms more restive than ever. As usual,  Snowball and Napoleon were in disagreement. According to Napoleon,  what the animals must do was to procure firearms and train themselves  in the use of them. According to Snowball, they must send out more  and more pigeons and stir up rebellion among the animals on the other  farms. The one argued that if they could not defend themselves they  were bound to be conquered, the other argued that if rebellions  happened everywhere they would have no need to defend themselves.  The animals listened first to Napoleon, then to Snowball, and could not  make up their minds which was right; indeed, they always found  themselves in agreement with the one who was speaking at the  moment.  At last the day came when Snowball's plans were completed. At the  Meeting on the following Sunday the question of whether or not to  begin work on the windmill was to be put to the vote. When the  animals had assembled in the big barn, Snowball stood up and, though  occasionally interrupted by bleating from the sheep, set forth his  reasons for advocating the building of the windmill. Then Napoleon  stood up to reply. He said very quietly that the windmill was nonsense  and that he advised nobody to vote for it, and promptly sat down again;  he had spoken for barely thirty seconds, and seemed almost indifferent  as to the effect he produced.

27","content":"shouting down the sheep, who had begun bleating again, broke into a  passionate appeal in favour of the windmill. Until now the animals had  been about equally divided in their sympathies, but in a moment  Snowball's eloquence had carried them away. In glowing sentences he  painted a picture of Animal Farm as it might be when sordid labour was  lifted from the animals' backs. His imagination had now run far beyond  chaff-cutters and turnip-slicers. Electricity, he said, could operate  threshing machines, ploughs, harrows, rollers, and reapers and binders,  besides supplying every stall with its own electric light, hot and cold  water, and an electric heater. By the time he had finished speaking,  there was no doubt as to which way the vote would go. But just at this  moment Napoleon stood up and, casting a peculiar sidelong look at  Snowball, uttered a high-pitched whimper of a kind no one had ever  heard him utter before.  At this there was a terrible baying sound outside, and nine enormous  dogs wearing brass-studded collars came bounding into the barn. They  dashed straight for Snowball, who only sprang from his place just in  time to escape their snapping jaws. In a moment he was out of the door  and they were after him. Too amazed and frightened to speak, all the  animals crowded through the door to watch the chase. Snowball was  racing across the long pasture that led to the road. He was running as  only a pig can run, but the dogs were close on his heels. Suddenly he  slipped and it seemed certain that they had him. Then he was up again,  running faster than ever, then the dogs were gaining on him again. One  of them all but closed his jaws on Snowball's tail, but Snowball  whisked it free just in time. Then he put on an extra spurt and, with a  few inches to spare, slipped through a hole in the hedge and was seen  no more.  Silent and terrified, the animals crept back into the barn. In a moment  the dogs came bounding back. At first no one had been able to imagine  where these creatures came from, but the problem was soon solved:  they were the puppies whom Napoleon had taken away from their  mothers and reared privately. Though not yet full-grown, they were  huge dogs, and as fierce-looking as wolves. They kept close to  Napoleon. It was noticed that they wagged their tails to him in the same  way as the other dogs had been used to do to Mr. Jones.

They were unnecessary, he said, and wasted  time. In future all questions relating to the working of the farm would  be settled by a special committee of pigs, presided over by himself.  These would meet in private and afterwards communicate their  decisions to the others. The animals would still assemble on Sunday  mornings to salute the flag, sing Beasts of England, and receive their  orders for the week; but there would be no more debates.  In spite of the shock that Snowball's expulsion had given them, the  animals were dismayed by this announcement. Several of them would  have protested if they could have found the right arguments. Even  Boxer was vaguely troubled. He set his ears back, shook his forelock  several times, and tried hard to marshal his thoughts; but in the end he  could not think of anything to say. Some of the pigs themselves,  however, were more articulate. Four young porkers in the front row  uttered shrill squeals of disapproval, and all four of them sprang to their  feet and began speaking at once. But suddenly the dogs sitting round  Napoleon let out deep, menacing growls, and the pigs fell silent and sat  down again. Then the sheep broke out into a tremendous bleating of  \"Four legs good, two legs bad!\" which went on for nearly a quarter of  an hour and put an end to any chance of discussion.  Afterwards Squealer was sent round the farm to explain the new  arrangement to the others.  \"Comrades,\" he said, \"I trust that every animal here appreciates the  sacrifice that Comrade Napoleon has made in taking this extra labour  upon himself. Do not imagine, comrades, that leadership is a pleasure!  On the contrary, it is a deep and heavy responsibility. No one believes  more firmly than Comrade Napoleon that all animals are equal. He  would be only too happy to let you make your decisions for yourselves.  But sometimes you might make the wrong decisions, comrades, and  then where should we be? Suppose you had decided to follow  Snowball, with his moonshine of windmills-Snowball, who, as we now  know, was no better than a criminal?\"  \"He fought bravely at the Battle of the Cowshed,\" said somebody.  \"Bravery is not enough,\" said Squealer. \"Loyalty and obedience are  more important. And as to the Battle of the Cowshed, I believe the time  will come when we shall find that Snowball's part in it was much  exaggerated. Discipline, comrades, iron discipline!

Surely, comrades, you do not want Jones back?\"  Once again this argument was unanswerable. Certainly the animals did  not want Jones back; if the holding of debates on Sunday mornings was  liable to bring him back, then the debates must stop. Boxer, who had  now had time to think things over, voiced the general feeling by saying:  \"If Comrade Napoleon says it, it must be right.\" And from then on he  adopted the maxim, \"Napoleon is always right,\" in addition to his  private motto of \"I will work harder.\"  By this time the weather had broken and the spring ploughing had  begun. The shed where Snowball had drawn his plans of the windmill  had been shut up and it was assumed that the plans had been rubbed off  the floor. Every Sunday morning at ten o'clock the animals assembled  in the big barn to receive their orders for the week. The skull of old  Major, now clean of flesh, had been disinterred from the orchard and  set up on a stump at the foot of the flagstaff, beside the gun. After the  hoisting of the flag, the animals were required to file past the skull in a  reverent manner before entering the barn. Nowadays they did not sit all  together as they had done in the past. Napoleon, with Squealer and  another pig named Minimus, who had a remarkable gift for composing  songs and poems, sat on the front of the raised platform, with the nine  young dogs forming a semicircle round them, and the other pigs sitting  behind. The rest of the animals sat facing them in the main body of the  barn. Napoleon read out the orders for the week in a gruff soldierly  style, and after a single singing of Beasts of England, all the animals  dispersed.  On the third Sunday after Snowball's expulsion, the animals were  somewhat surprised to hear Napoleon announce that the windmill was  to be built after all. He did not give any reason for having changed his  mind, but merely warned the animals that this extra task would mean  very hard work, it might even be necessary to reduce their rations. The  plans, however, had all been prepared, down to the last detail. A special  committee of pigs had been at work upon them for the past three weeks.  The building of the windmill, with various other improvements, was  expected to take two years.  That evening Squealer explained privately to the other animals that  Napoleon had never in reality been opposed to the windmill.

The windmill was,  in fact, Napoleon's own creation. Why, then, asked somebody, had he  spoken so strongly against it? Here Squealer looked very sly. That, he  said, was Comrade Napoleon's cunning. He had seemed to oppose the  windmill, simply as a manoeuvre to get rid of Snowball, who was a  dangerous character and a bad influence. Now that Snowball was out of  the way, the plan could go forward without his interference. This, said  Squealer, was something called tactics. He repeated a number of times,  \"Tactics, comrades, tactics!\" skipping round and whisking his tail with  a merry laugh. The animals were not certain what the word meant, but  Squealer spoke so persuasively, and the three dogs who happened to be  with him growled so threateningly, that they accepted his explanation  without further questions.  VI  ALL that year the animals worked like slaves. But they were happy in  their work; they grudged no effort or sacrifice, well aware that  everything that they did was for the benefit of themselves and those of  their kind who would come after them, and not for a pack of idle,  thieving human beings.  Throughout the spring and summer they worked a sixty-hour week, and  in August Napoleon announced that there would be work on Sunday  afternoons as well. This work was strictly voluntary, but any animal  who absented himself from it would have his rations reduced by half.  Even so, it was found necessary to leave certain tasks undone. The  harvest was a little less successful than in the previous year, and two  fields which should have been sown with roots in the early summer  were not sown because the ploughing had not been completed early  enough. It was possible to foresee that the coming winter would be a  hard one.  The windmill presented unexpected difficulties. There was a good  quarry of limestone on the farm, and plenty of sand and cement had  been found in one of the outhouses, so that all the materials for building  were at hand. But the problem the animals could not at first solve was  how to break up the stone into pieces of suitable size.

Only after  weeks of vain effort did the right idea occur to somebody-namely, to  utilise the force of gravity. Huge boulders, far too big to be used as they  were, were lying all over the bed of the quarry. The animals lashed  ropes round these, and then all together, cows, horses, sheep, any  animal that could lay hold of the rope-even the pigs sometimes joined  in at critical moments-they dragged them with desperate slowness up  the slope to the top of the quarry, where they were toppled over the  edge, to shatter to pieces below. Transporting the stone when it was  once broken was comparatively simple. The horses carried it off in  cart-loads, the sheep dragged single blocks, even Muriel and Benjamin  yoked themselves into an old governess-cart and did their share. By late  summer a sufficient store of stone had accumulated, and then the  building began, under the superintendence of the pigs.  But it was a slow, laborious process. Frequently it took a whole day of  exhausting effort to drag a single boulder to the top of the quarry, and  sometimes when it was pushed over the edge it failed to break. Nothing  could have been achieved without Boxer, whose strength seemed equal  to that of all the rest of the animals put together. When the boulder  began to slip and the animals cried out in despair at finding themselves  dragged down the hill, it was always Boxer who strained himself  against the rope and brought the boulder to a stop. To see him toiling  up the slope inch by inch, his breath coming fast, the tips of his hoofs  clawing at the ground, and his great sides matted with sweat, filled  everyone with admiration. Clover warned him sometimes to be careful  not to overstrain himself, but Boxer would never listen to her. His two  slogans, \"I will work harder\" and \"Napoleon is always right,\" seemed to  him a sufficient answer to all problems. He had made arrangements  with the cockerel to call him three-quarters of an hour earlier in the  mornings instead of half an hour. And in his spare moments, of which  there were not many nowadays, he would go alone to the quarry, collect  a load of broken stone, and drag it down to the site of the windmill  unassisted.  The animals were not badly off throughout that summer, in spite of the  hardness of their work. If they had no more food than they had had in  Jones's day, at least they did not have less. The advantage of only  having to feed themselves, and not having to support five extravagant  human beings as well, was so great that it would have taken a lot of  failures to outweigh it.

Such jobs as weeding, for  instance, could be done with a thoroughness impossible to human  beings. And again, since no animal now stole, it was unnecessary to  fence off pasture from arable land, which saved a lot of labour on the  upkeep of hedges and gates. Nevertheless, as the summer wore on,  various unforeseen shortages began to make them selves felt. There was  need of paraffin oil, nails, string, dog biscuits, and iron for the horses'  shoes, none of which could be produced on the farm. Later there would  also be need for seeds and artificial manures, besides various tools and,  finally, the machinery for the windmill. How these were to be procured,  no one was able to imagine.  One Sunday morning, when the animals assembled to receive their  orders, Napoleon announced that he had decided upon a new policy.  From now onwards Animal Farm would engage in trade with the  neighbouring farms: not, of course, for any commercial purpose, but  simply in order to obtain certain materials which were urgently  necessary. The needs of the windmill must override everything else, he  said. He was therefore making arrangements to sell a stack of hay and  part of the current year's wheat crop, and later on, if more money were  needed, it would have to be made up by the sale of eggs, for which  there was always a market in Willingdon. The hens, said Napoleon,  should welcome this sacrifice as their own special contribution towards  the building of the windmill.  Once again the animals were conscious of a vague uneasiness. Never to  have any dealings with human beings, never to engage in trade, never  to make use of money-had not these been among the earliest resolutions  passed at that first triumphant Meeting after Jones was expelled? All  the animals remembered passing such resolutions: or at least they  thought that they remembered it. The four young pigs who had  protested when Napoleon abolished the Meetings raised their voices  timidly, but they were promptly silenced by a tremendous growling  from the dogs. Then, as usual, the sheep broke into \"Four legs good,  two legs bad!\" and the momentary awkwardness was smoothed over.  Finally Napoleon raised his trotter for silence and announced that he  had already made all the arrangements. There would be no need for any  of the animals to come in contact with human beings, which would  clearly be most undesirable. He intended to take the whole burden upon  his own shoulders.

Napoleon ended his speech with his usual cry of \"Long  live Animal Farm!\" and after the singing of Beasts of England the  animals were dismissed.  Afterwards Squealer made a round of the farm and set the animals'  minds at rest. He assured them that the resolution against engaging in  trade and using money had never been passed, or even suggested. It  was pure imagination, probably traceable in the beginning to lies  circulated by Snowball. A few animals still felt faintly doubtful, but  Squealer asked them shrewdly, \"Are you certain that this is not  something that you have dreamed, comrades? Have you any record of  such a resolution? Is it written down anywhere?\" And since it was  certainly true that nothing of the kind existed in writing, the animals  were satisfied that they had been mistaken.  Every Monday Mr. Whymper visited the farm as had been arranged. He  was a sly-looking little man with side whiskers, a solicitor in a very  small way of business, but sharp enough to have realised earlier than  anyone else that Animal Farm would need a broker and that the  commissions would be worth having. The animals watched his coming  and going with a kind of dread, and avoided him as much as possible.  Nevertheless, the sight of Napoleon, on all fours, delivering orders to  Whymper, who stood on two legs, roused their pride and partly  reconciled them to the new arrangement. Their relations with the  human race were now not quite the same as they had been before. The  human beings did not hate Animal Farm any less now that it was  prospering; indeed, they hated it more than ever. Every human being  held it as an article of faith that the farm would go bankrupt sooner or  later, and, above all, that the windmill would be a failure. They would  meet in the public-houses and prove to one another by means of  diagrams that the windmill was bound to fall down, or that if it did  stand up, then that it would never work. And yet, against their will, they  had developed a certain respect for the efficiency with which the  animals were managing their own affairs. One symptom of this was that  they had begun to call Animal Farm by its proper name and ceased to  pretend that it was called the Manor Farm. They had also dropped their  championship of Jones, who had given up hope of getting his farm back  and gone to live in another part of the county.

34","content":"about to enter into a definite business agreement either with Mr.  Pilkington of Foxwood or with Mr. Frederick of Pinchfield-but never, it  was noticed, with both simultaneously.  It was about this time that the pigs suddenly moved into the farmhouse  and took up their residence there. Again the animals seemed to  remember that a resolution against this had been passed in the early  days, and again Squealer was able to convince them that this was not  the case. It was absolutely necessary, he said, that the pigs, who were  the brains of the farm, should have a quiet place to work in. It was also  more suited to the dignity of the Leader (for of late he had taken to  speaking of Napoleon under the title of \"Leader\") to live in a house  than in a mere sty. Nevertheless, some of the animals were disturbed  when they heard that the pigs not only took their meals in the kitchen  and used the drawing-room as a recreation room, but also slept in the  beds. Boxer passed it off as usual with \"Napoleon is always right!\", but  Clover, who thought she remembered a definite ruling against beds,  went to the end of the barn and tried to puzzle out the Seven  Commandments which were inscribed there. Finding herself unable to  read more than individual letters, she fetched Muriel.  \"Muriel,\" she said, \"read me the Fourth Commandment. Does it not say  something about never sleeping in a bed?\"  With some difficulty Muriel spelt it out.  \"It says, 'No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets,\"' she announced  finally.  Curiously enough, Clover had not remembered that the Fourth  Commandment mentioned sheets; but as it was there on the wall, it  must have done so. And Squealer, who happened to be passing at this  moment, attended by two or three dogs, was able to put the whole  matter in its proper perspective.  \"You have heard then, comrades,\" he said, \"that we pigs now sleep in  the beds of the farmhouse? And why not? You did not suppose, surely,  that there was ever a ruling against beds? A bed merely means a place  to sleep in. A pile of straw in a stall is a bed, properly regarded. The  rule was against sheets, which are a human invention. We have  removed the sheets from the farmhouse beds, and sleep between  blankets. And very comfortable beds they are too!

You would not rob us of our  repose, would you, comrades? You would not have us too tired to carry  out our duties? Surely none of you wishes to see Jones back?\"  The animals reassured him on this point immediately, and no more was  said about the pigs sleeping in the farmhouse beds. And when, some  days afterwards, it was announced that from now on the pigs would get  up an hour later in the mornings than the other animals, no complaint  was made about that either.  By the autumn the animals were tired but happy. They had had a hard  year, and after the sale of part of the hay and corn, the stores of food for  the winter were none too plentiful, but the windmill compensated for  everything. It was almost half built now. After the harvest there was a  stretch of clear dry weather, and the animals toiled harder than ever,  thinking it well worth while to plod to and fro all day with blocks of  stone if by doing so they could raise the walls another foot. Boxer  would even come out at nights and work for an hour or two on his own  by the light of the harvest moon. In their spare moments the animals  would walk round and round the half-finished mill, admiring the  strength and perpendicularity of its walls and marvelling that they  should ever have been able to build anything so imposing. Only old  Benjamin refused to grow enthusiastic about the windmill, though, as  usual, he would utter nothing beyond the cryptic remark that donkeys  live a long time.  November came, with raging south-west winds. Building had to stop  because it was now too wet to mix the cement. Finally there came a  night when the gale was so violent that the farm buildings rocked on  their foundations and several tiles were blown off the roof of the barn.  The hens woke up squawking with terror because they had all dreamed  simultaneously of hearing a gun go off in the distance. In the morning  the animals came out of their stalls to find that the flagstaff had been  blown down and an elm tree at the foot of the orchard had been plucked  up like a radish. They had just noticed this when a cry of despair broke  from every animal's throat. A terrible sight had met their eyes. The  windmill was in ruins.  With one accord they dashed down to the spot. Napoleon, who seldom  moved out of a walk, raced ahead of them all.

His tail had grown rigid and twitched sharply from side to side,  a sign in him of intense mental activity. Suddenly he halted as though  his mind were made up.  \"Comrades,\" he said quietly, \"do you know who is responsible for this?  Do you know the enemy who has come in the night and overthrown our  windmill? SNOWBALL!\" he suddenly roared in a voice of thunder.  \"Snowball has done this thing! In sheer malignity, thinking to set back  our plans and avenge himself for his ignominious expulsion, this traitor  has crept here under cover of night and destroyed our work of nearly a  year. Comrades, here and now I pronounce the death sentence upon  Snowball. 'Animal Hero, Second Class,' and half a bushel of apples to  any animal who brings him to justice. A full bushel to anyone who  captures him alive!\"  The animals were shocked beyond measure to learn that even Snowball  could be guilty of such an action. There was a cry of indignation, and  everyone began thinking out ways of catching Snowball if he should  ever come back. Almost immediately the footprints of a pig were  discovered in the grass at a little distance from the knoll. They could  only be traced for a few yards, but appeared to lead to a hole in the  hedge. Napoleon snuffed deeply at them and pronounced them to be  Snowball's. He gave it as his opinion that Snowball had probably come  from the direction of Foxwood Farm.  \"No more delays, comrades!\" cried Napoleon when the footprints had  been examined. \"There is work to be done. This very morning we begin  rebuilding the windmill, and we will build all through the winter, rain  or shine. We will teach this miserable traitor that he cannot undo our  work so easily. Remember, comrades, there must be no alteration in our  plans: they shall be carried out to the day. Forward, comrades! Long  live the windmill!

37","content":"VII  IT WAS a bitter winter. The stormy weather was followed by sleet and  snow, and then by a hard frost which did not break till well into  February. The animals carried on as best they could with the rebuilding  of the windmill, well knowing that the outside world was watching  them and that the envious human beings would rejoice and triumph if  the mill were not finished on time.  Out of spite, the human beings pretended not to believe that it was  Snowball who had destroyer the windmill: they said that it had fallen  down because the walls were too thin. The animals knew that this was  not the case. Still, it had been decided to build the walls three feet thick  this time instead of eighteen inches as before, which meant collecting  much larger quantities of stone. For a long i.ne the quarry was full of  snowdrifts and nothing could be done. Some progress was made in the  dry frosty weather that followed, but it was cruel work, and the animals  could not feel so hopeful about it as they had felt before. They were  always cold, and usually hungry as well. Only Boxer and Clover never  lost heart. Squealer made excellent speeches on the joy of service and  the dignity of labour, but the other animals found more inspiration in  Boxer's strength and his never-failing cry of \"I will work harder! \"  In January food fell short. The corn ration was drastically reduced, and  it was announced that an extra potato ration would be issued to make up  for it. Then it was discovered that the greater part of the potato crop had  been frosted in the clamps, which had not been covered thickly enough.  The potatoes had become soft and discoloured, and only a few were  edible. For days at a time the animals had nothing to eat but chaff and  mangels. Starvation seemed to stare them in the face.  It was vitally necessary to conceal this fact from the outside world.  Emboldened by the collapse of the windmill, the human beings were  inventing fresh lies about Animal Farm. Once again it was being put  about that all the animals were dying of famine and disease, and that  they were continually fighting among themselves and had resorted to  cannibalism and infanticide. Napoleon was well aware of the bad  results that might follow if the real facts of the food situation were  known, and he decided to make use of Mr. Whymper to spread a  contrary impression.

In addition, Napoleon ordered the  almost empty bins in the store-shed to be filled nearly to the brim with  sand, which was then covered up with what remained of the grain and  meal. On some suitable pretext Whymper was led through the  store-shed and allowed to catch a glimpse of the bins. He was deceived,  and continued to report to the outside world that there was no food  shortage on Animal Farm.  Nevertheless, towards the end of January it became obvious that it  would be necessary to procure some more grain from somewhere. In  these days Napoleon rarely appeared in public, but spent all his time in  the farmhouse, which was guarded at each door by fierce-looking dogs.  When he did emerge, it was in a ceremonial manner, with an escort of  six dogs who closely surrounded him and growled if anyone came too  near. Frequently he did not even appear on Sunday mornings, but  issued his orders through one of the other pigs, usually Squealer.  One Sunday morning Squealer announced that the hens, who had just  come in to lay again, must surrender their eggs. Napoleon had accepted,  through Whymper, a contract for four hundred eggs a week. The price  of these would pay for enough grain and meal to keep the farm going  till summer came on and conditions were easier.  When the hens heard this, they raised a terrible outcry. They had been  warned earlier that this sacrifice might be necessary, but had not  believed that it would really happen. They were just getting their  clutches ready for the spring sitting, and they protested that to take the  eggs away now was murder. For the first time since the expulsion of  Jones, there was something resembling a rebellion. Led by three young  Black Minorca pullets, the hens made a determined effort to thwart  Napoleon's wishes. Their method was to fly up to the rafters and there  lay their eggs, which smashed to pieces on the floor. Napoleon acted  swiftly and ruthlessly. He ordered the hens' rations to be stopped, and  decreed that any animal giving so much as a grain of corn to a hen  should be punished by death. The dogs saw to it that these orders were  carried out. For five days the hens held out, then they capitulated and  went back to their nesting boxes. Nine hens had died in the meantime.  Their bodies were buried in the orchard, and it was given out that they  had died of coccidiosis.

39","content":"All this while no more had been seen of Snowball. He was rumoured to  be hiding on one of the neighbouring farms, either Foxwood or  Pinchfield. Napoleon was by this time on slightly better terms with the  other farmers than before. It happened that there was in the yard a pile  of timber which had been stacked there ten years earlier when a beech  spinney was cleared. It was well seasoned, and Whymper had advised  Napoleon to sell it; both Mr. Pilkington and Mr. Frederick were  anxious to buy it. Napoleon was hesitating between the two, unable to  make up his mind. It was noticed that whenever he seemed on the point  of coming to an agreement with Frederick, Snowball was declared to be  in hiding at Foxwood, while, when he inclined toward Pilkington,  Snowball was said to be at Pinchfield.  Suddenly, early in the spring, an alarming thing was discovered.  Snowball was secretly frequenting the farm by night! The animals were  so disturbed that they could hardly sleep in their stalls. Every night, it  was said, he came creeping in under cover of darkness and performed  all kinds of mischief. He stole the corn, he upset the milk-pails, he  broke the eggs, he trampled the seedbeds, he gnawed the bark off the  fruit trees. Whenever anything went wrong it became usual to attribute  it to Snowball. If a window was broken or a drain was blocked up,  someone was certain to say that Snowball had come in the night and  done it, and when the key of the store-shed was lost, the whole farm  was convinced that Snowball had thrown it down the well. Curiously  enough, they went on believing this even after the mislaid key was  found under a sack of meal. The cows declared unanimously that  Snowball crept into their stalls and milked them in their sleep. The rats,  which had been troublesome that winter, were also said to be in league  with Snowball.  Napoleon decreed that there should be a full investigation into  Snowball's activities. With his dogs in attendance he set out and made a  careful tour of inspection of the farm buildings, the other animals  following at a respectful distance. At every few steps Napoleon stopped  and snuffed the ground for traces of Snowball's footsteps, which, he  said, he could detect by the smell. He snuffed in every corner, in the  barn, in the cow-shed, in the henhouses, in the vegetable garden, and  found traces of Snowball almost everywhere.

The animals were thoroughly frightened. It seemed to them as though  Snowball were some kind of invisible influence, pervading the air about  them and menacing them with all kinds of dangers. In the evening  Squealer called them together, and with an alarmed expression on his  face told them that he had some serious news to report.  \"Comrades!\" cried Squealer, making little nervous skips, \"a most  terrible thing has been discovered. Snowball has sold himself to  Frederick of Pinchfield Farm, who is even now plotting to attack us and  take our farm away from us! Snowball is to act as his guide when the  attack begins. But there is worse than that. We had thought that  Snowball's rebellion was caused simply by his vanity and ambition. But  we were wrong, comrades. Do you know what the real reason was?  Snowball was in league with Jones from the very start! He was Jones's  secret agent all the time. It has all been proved by documents which he  left behind him and which we have only just discovered. To my mind  this explains a great deal, comrades. Did we not see for ourselves how  he attempted-fortunately without success-to get us defeated and  destroyed at the Battle of the Cowshed?\"  The animals were stupefied. This was a wickedness far outdoing  Snowball's destruction of the windmill. But it was some minutes before  they could fully take it in. They all remembered, or thought they  remembered, how they had seen Snowball charging ahead of them at  the Battle of the Cowshed, how he had rallied and encouraged them at  every turn, and how he had not paused for an instant even when the  pellets from Jones's gun had wounded his back. At first it was a little  difficult to see how this fitted in with his being on Jones's side. Even  Boxer, who seldom asked questions, was puzzled. He lay down, tucked  his fore hoofs beneath him, shut his eyes, and with a hard effort  managed to formulate his thoughts.  \"I do not believe that,\" he said. \"Snowball fought bravely at the Battle  of the Cowshed. I saw him myself. Did we not give him 'Animal Hero,  first Class,' immediately afterwards?\"  \"That was our mistake, comrade.

I could show you this in his own writing, if you were able  to read it. The plot was for Snowball, at the critical moment, to give the  signal for flight and leave the field to the enemy. And he very nearly  succeeded-I will even say, comrades, he would have succeeded if it had  not been for our heroic Leader, Comrade Napoleon. Do you not  remember how, just at the moment when Jones and his men had got  inside the yard, Snowball suddenly turned and fled, and many animals  followed him? And do you not remember, too, that it was just at that  moment, when panic was spreading and all seemed lost, that Comrade  Napoleon sprang forward with a cry of 'Death to Humanity!' and sank  his teeth in Jones's leg? Surely you remember that, comrades?\"  exclaimed Squealer, frisking from side to side.  Now when Squealer described the scene so graphically, it seemed to the  animals that they did remember it. At any rate, they remembered that at  the critical moment of the battle Snowball had turned to flee. But Boxer  was still a little uneasy.  \"I do not believe that Snowball was a traitor at the beginning,\" he said  finally. \"What he has done since is different. But I believe that at the  Battle of the Cowshed he was a good comrade.\"  \"Our Leader, Comrade Napoleon,\" announced Squealer, speaking very  slowly and firmly, \"has stated categorically-categorically, comrade-that  Snowball was Jones's agent from the very beginning-yes, and from long  before the Rebellion was ever thought of.\"  \"Ah, that is different!\" said Boxer. \"If Comrade Napoleon says it, it  must be right.\"  \"That is the true spirit, comrade!\" cried Squealer, but it was noticed he  cast a very ugly look at Boxer with his little twinkling eyes. He turned  to go, then paused and added impressively: \"I warn every animal on  this farm to keep his eyes very wide open. For we have reason to think  that some of Snowball's secret agents are lurking among us at this  moment! \"  Four days later, in the late afternoon, Napoleon ordered all the animals  to assemble in the yard.

42","content":"he had recently awarded himself \"Animal Hero, First Class,\" and  \"Animal Hero, Second Class\"), with his nine huge dogs frisking round  him and uttering growls that sent shivers down all the animals' spines.  They all cowered silently in their places, seeming to know in advance  that some terrible thing was about to happen.  Napoleon stood sternly surveying his audience; then he uttered a  high-pitched whimper. Immediately the dogs bounded forward, seized  four of the pigs by the ear and dragged them, squealing with pain and  terror, to Napoleon's feet. The pigs' ears were bleeding, the dogs had  tasted blood, and for a few moments they appeared to go quite mad. To  the amazement of everybody, three of them flung themselves upon  Boxer. Boxer saw them coming and put out his great hoof, caught a dog  in mid-air, and pinned him to the ground. The dog shrieked for mercy  and the other two fled with their tails between their legs. Boxer looked  at Napoleon to know whether he should crush the dog to death or let it  go. Napoleon appeared to change countenance, and sharply ordered  Boxer to let the dog go, whereat Boxer lifted his hoof, and the dog  slunk away, bruised and howling.  Presently the tumult died down. The four pigs waited, trembling, with  guilt written on every line of their countenances. Napoleon now called  upon them to confess their crimes. They were the same four pigs as had  protested when Napoleon abolished the Sunday Meetings. Without any  further prompting they confessed that they had been secretly in touch  with Snowball ever since his expulsion, that they had collaborated with  him in destroying the windmill, and that they had entered into an  agreement with him to hand over Animal Farm to Mr. Frederick. They  added that Snowball had privately admitted to them that he had been  Jones's secret agent for years past. When they had finished their  confession, the dogs promptly tore their throats out, and in a terrible  voice Napoleon demanded whether any other animal had anything to  confess.  The three hens who had been the ringleaders in the attempted rebellion  over the eggs now came forward and stated that Snowball had appeared  to them in a dream and incited them to disobey Napoleon's orders.  They, too, were slaughtered. Then a goose came forward and confessed  to having secreted six ears of corn during the last year's harvest and  eaten them in the night.

43","content":"devoted follower of Napoleon, by chasing him round and round a  bonfire when he was suffering from a cough. They were all slain on the  spot. And so the tale of confessions and executions went on, until there  was a pile of corpses lying before Napoleon's feet and the air was heavy  with the smell of blood, which had been unknown there since the  expulsion of Jones.  When it was all over, the remaining animals, except for the pigs and  dogs, crept away in a body. They were shaken and miserable. They did  not know which was more shocking-the treachery of the animals who  had leagued themselves with Snowball, or the cruel retribution they had  just witnessed. In the old days there had often been scenes of bloodshed  equally terrible, but it seemed to all of them that it was far worse now  that it was happening among themselves. Since Jones had left the farm,  until today, no animal had killed another animal. Not even a rat had  been killed. They had made their way on to the little knoll where the  half-finished windmill stood, and with one accord they all lay down as  though huddling together for warmth-Clover, Muriel, Benjamin, the  cows, the sheep, and a whole flock of geese and hens-everyone, indeed,  except the cat, who had suddenly disappeared just before Napoleon  ordered the animals to assemble. For some time nobody spoke. Only  Boxer remained on his feet. He fidgeted to and fro, swishing his long  black tail against his sides and occasionally uttering a little whinny of  surprise. Finally he said:  \"I do not understand it. I would not have believed that such things could  happen on our farm. It must be due to some fault in ourselves. The  solution, as I see it, is to work harder. From now onwards I shall get up  a full hour earlier in the mornings.\"  And he moved off at his lumbering trot and made for the quarry.  Having got there, he collected two successive loads of stone and  dragged them down to the windmill before retiring for the night.  The animals huddled about Clover, not speaking. The knoll where they  were lying gave them a wide prospect across the countryside. Most of  Animal Farm was within their view-the long pasture stretching down to  the main road, the hayfield, the spinney, the drinking pool, the  ploughed fields where the young wheat was thick and green, and the  red roofs of the farm buildings with the smoke curling from the  chimneys.

As Clover looked down the hillside her eyes filled with tears. If  she could have spoken her thoughts, it would have been to say that this  was not what they had aimed at when they had set themselves years ago  to work for the overthrow of the human race. These scenes of terror and  slaughter were not what they had looked forward to on that night when  old Major first stirred them to rebellion. If she herself had had any  picture of the future, it had been of a society of animals set free from  hunger and the whip, all equal, each working according to his capacity,  the strong protecting the weak, as she had protected the lost brood of  ducklings with her foreleg on the night of Major's speech. Instead-she  did not know why-they had come to a time when no one dared speak  his mind, when fierce, growling dogs roamed everywhere, and when  you had to watch your comrades torn to pieces after confessing to  shocking crimes. There was no thought of rebellion or disobedience in  her mind. She knew that, even as things were, they were far better off  than they had been in the days of Jones, and that before all else it was  needful to prevent the return of the human beings. Whatever happened  she would remain faithful, work hard, carry out the orders that were  given to her, and accept the leadership of Napoleon. But still, it was not  for this that she and all the other animals had hoped and toiled. It was  not for this that they had built the windmill and faced the bullets of  Jones's gun. Such were her thoughts, though she lacked the words to  express them.  At last, feeling this to be in some way a substitute for the words she  was unable to find, she began to sing Beasts of England. The other  animals sitting round her took it up, and they sang it three times  over-very tunefully, but slowly and mournfully, in a way they had  never sung it before.  They had just finished singing it for the third time when Squealer,  attended by two dogs, approached them with the air of having  something important to say. He announced that, by a special decree of  Comrade Napoleon, Beasts of England had been abolished. From now  onwards it was forbidden to sing it.

But the Rebellion is now  completed. The execution of the traitors this afternoon was the final act.  The enemy both external and internal has been defeated. In Beasts of  England we expressed our longing for a better society in days to come.  But that society has now been established. Clearly this song has no  longer any purpose.\"  Frightened though they were, some of the animals might possibly have  protested, but at this moment the sheep set up their usual bleating of  \"Four legs good, two legs bad,\" which went on for several minutes and  put an end to the discussion.  So Beasts of England was heard no more. In its place Minimus, the  poet, had composed another song which began:  Animal Farm, Animal Farm,  Never through me shalt thou come to harm!  and this was sung every Sunday morning after the hoisting of the flag.

It ran: \"No animal shall kill any other animal  without cause.\" Somehow or other, the last two words had slipped out  of the animals' memory. But they saw now that the Commandment had  not been violated; for clearly there was good reason for killing the  traitors who had leagued themselves with Snowball.

46","content":"worked in the previous year To rebuild the windmill, with walls twice  as thick as before, and to finish it by the appointed date, together with  the regular work of the farm, was a tremendous labour. There were  times when it seemed to the animals that they worked longer hours and  fed no better than they had done in Jones's day. On Sunday mornings  Squealer, holding down a long strip of paper with his trotter, would  read out to them lists of figures proving that the production of every  class of foodstuff had increased by two hundred per cent, three hundred  per cent, or five hundred per cent, as the case might be. The animals  saw no reason to disbelieve him, especially as they could no longer  remember very clearly what conditions had been like before the  Rebellion. All the same, there were days when they felt that they would  sooner have had less figures and more food.  All orders were now issued through Squealer or one of the other pigs.  Napoleon himself was not seen in public as often as once in a fortnight.  When he did appear, he was attended not only by his retinue of dogs  but by a black cockerel who marched in front of him and acted as a  kind of trumpeter, letting out a loud \"cock-a-doodle-doo\" before  Napoleon spoke. Even in the farmhouse, it was said, Napoleon  inhabited separate apartments from the others. He took his meals alone,  with two dogs to wait upon him, and always ate from the Crown Derby  dinner service which had been in the glass cupboard in the  drawing-room. It was also announced that the gun would be fired every  year on Napoleon's birthday, as well as on the other two anniversaries.  Napoleon was now never spoken of simply as \"Napoleon.\" He was  always referred to in formal style as \"our Leader, Comrade Napoleon,\"  and this pigs liked to invent for him such titles as Father of All  Animals, Terror of Mankind, Protector of the Sheep-fold, Ducklings'  Friend, and the like. In his speeches, Squealer would talk with the tears  rolling down his cheeks of Napoleon's wisdom the goodness of his  heart, and the deep love he bore to all animals everywhere, even and  especially the unhappy animals who still lived in ignorance and slavery  on other farms. It had become usual to give Napoleon the credit for  every successful achievement and every stroke of good fortune. You  would often hear one hen remark to another, \"Under the guidance of  our Leader, Comrade Napoleon, I have laid five eggs in six days\"; or  two cows, enjoying a drink at the pool, would exclaim,

It was surmounted by a portrait of Napoleon, in  profile, executed by Squealer in white paint.  Meanwhile, through the agency of Whymper, Napoleon was engaged in  complicated negotiations with Frederick and Pilkington. The pile of  timber was still unsold. Of the two, Frederick was the more anxious to  get hold of it, but he would not offer a reasonable price. At the same  time there were renewed rumours that Frederick and his men were  plotting to attack Animal Farm and to destroy the windmill, the  building of which had aroused furious jealousy in him. Snowball was  known to be still skulking on Pinchfield Farm. In the middle of the  summer the animals were alarmed to hear that three hens had come  forward and confessed that, inspired by Snowball, they had entered into  a plot to murder Napoleon. They were executed immediately, and fresh  precautions for Napoleon's safety were taken. Four dogs guarded his  bed at night, one at each corner, and a young pig named Pinkeye was  given the task of tasting all his food before he ate it, lest it should be  poisoned.  At about the same time it was given out that Napoleon had arranged to  sell the pile of timber to Mr. Pilkington; he was also going to enter into  a regular agreement for the exchange of certain products between  Animal Farm and Foxwood. The relations between Napoleon and  Pilkington, though they were only conducted through Whymper, were  now almost friendly. The animals distrusted Pilkington, as a human  being, but greatly preferred him to Frederick, whom they both feared  and hated. As the summer wore on, and the windmill neared  completion, the rumours of an impending treacherous attack grew  stronger and stronger. Frederick, it was said, intended to bring against  them twenty men all armed with guns, and he had already bribed the  magistrates and police, so that if he could once get hold of the  title-deeds of Animal Farm they would ask no questions. Moreover,  terrible stories were leaking out from Pinchfield about the cruelties that  Frederick practised upon his animals. He had flogged an old horse to  death, he starved his cows, he had killed a dog by throwing it into the  furnace, he amused himself in the evenings by making cocks fight with  splinters of razor-blade tied to their spurs. The animals' blood boiled  with rage when they heard of these things beingdone to their comrades,  and sometimes they clamoured to be allowed to go out in a body and  attack Pinchfield Farm, drive out the humans, and set the animals free.

49","content":"Comrade Napoleon's strategy.  Nevertheless, feeling against Frederick continued to run high. One  Sunday morning Napoleon appeared in the barn and explained that he  had never at any time contemplated selling the pile of timber to  Frederick; he considered it beneath his dignity, he said, to have dealings  with scoundrels of that description. The pigeons who were still sent out  to spread tidings of the Rebellion were forbidden to set foot anywhere  on Foxwood, and were also ordered to drop their former slogan of  \"Death to Humanity\" in favour of \"Death to Frederick.\" In the late  summer yet another of Snowball's machinations was laid bare. The  wheat crop was full of weeds, and it was discovered that on one of his  nocturnal visits Snowball had mixed weed seeds with the seed corn. A  gander who had been privy to the plot had confessed his guilt to  Squealer and immediately committed suicide by swallowing deadly  nightshade berries. The animals now also learned that Snowball had  never-as many of them had believed hitherto-received the order of  \"Animal Hero7 First Class.\" This was merely a legend which had been  spread some time after the Battle of the Cowshed by Snowball himself.  So far from being decorated, he had been censured for showing  cowardice in the battle. Once again some of the animals heard this with  a certain bewilderment, but Squealer was soon able to convince them  that their memories had been at fault.  In the autumn, by a tremendous, exhausting effort-for the harvest had to  be gathered at almost the same time-the windmill was finished. The  machinery had still to be installed, and Whymper was negotiating the  purchase of it, but the structure was completed. In the teeth of every  difficulty, in spite of inexperience, of primitive implements, of bad luck  and of Snowball's treachery, the work had been finished punctually to  the very day! Tired out but proud, the animals walked round and round  their masterpiece, which appeared even more beautiful in their eyes  than when it had been built the first time. Moreover, the walls were  twice as thick as before. Nothing short of explosives would lay them  low this time! And when they thought of how they had laboured, what  discouragements they had overcome, and the enormous difference that  would be made in their lives when the sails were turning and the  dynamos running-when they thought of all this, their tiredness forsook  them and they gambolled round and round the windmill, uttering cries  of triumph.

Two days later the animals were called together for a special meeting in  the barn. They were struck dumb with surprise when Napoleon  announced that he had sold the pile of timber to Frederick. Tomorrow  Frederick's wagons would arrive and begin carting it away. Throughout  the whole period of his seeming friendship with Pilkington, Napoleon  had really been in secret agreement with Frederick.  All relations with Foxwood had been broken off; insulting messages  had been sent to Pilkington. The pigeons had been told to avoid  Pinchfield Farm and to alter their slogan from \"Death to Frederick\" to  \"Death to Pilkington.\" At the same time Napoleon assured the animals  that the stories of an impending attack on Animal Farm were  completely untrue, and that the tales about Frederick's cruelty to his  own animals had been greatly exaggerated. All these rumours had  probably originated with Snowball and his agents. It now appeared that  Snowball was not, after all, hiding on Pinchfield Farm, and in fact had  never been there in his life: he was living-in considerable luxury, so it  was said-at Foxwood, and had in reality been a pensioner of Pilkington  for years past.  The pigs were in ecstasies over Napoleon's cunning. By seeming to be  friendly with Pilkington he had forced Frederick to raise his price by  twelve pounds. But the superior quality of Napoleon's mind, said  Squealer, was shown in the fact that he trusted nobody, not even  Frederick. Frederick had wanted to pay for the timber with something  called a cheque, which, it seemed, was a piece of paper with a promise  to pay written upon it. But Napoleon was too clever for him. He had  demanded payment in real five-pound notes, which were to be handed  over before the timber was removed. Already Frederick had paid up;  and the sum he had paid was just enough to buy the machinery for the  windmill.  Meanwhile the timber was being carted away at high speed. When it  was all gone, another special meeting was held in the barn for the  animals to inspect Frederick's bank-notes. Smiling beatifically, and  wearing both his decorations, Napoleon reposed on a bed of straw on  the platform, with the money at his side, neatly piled on a china dish  from the farmhouse kitchen.

Three days later there was a terrible hullabaloo. Whymper, his face  deadly pale, came racing up the path on his bicycle, flung it down in the  yard and rushed straight into the farmhouse. The next moment a  choking roar of rage sounded from Napoleon's apartments. The news of  what had happened sped round the farm like wildfire. The banknotes  were forgeries! Frederick had got the timber for nothing!  Napoleon called the animals together immediately and in a terrible  voice pronounced the death sentence upon Frederick. When captured,  he said, Frederick should be boiled alive. At the same time he warned  them that after this treacherous deed the worst was to be expected.  Frederick and his men might make their long-expected attack at any  moment. Sentinels were placed at all the approaches to the farm. In  addition, four pigeons were sent to Foxwood with a conciliatory  message, which it was hoped might re-establish good relations with  Pilkington.  The very next morning the attack came. The animals were at breakfast  when the look-outs came racing in with the news that Frederick and his  followers had already come through the five-barred gate. Boldly  enough the animals sallied forth to meet them, but this time they did not  have the easy victory that they had had in the Battle of the Cowshed.  There were fifteen men, with half a dozen guns between them, and they  opened fire as soon as they got within fifty yards. The animals could  not face the terrible explosions and the stinging pellets, and in spite of  the efforts of Napoleon and Boxer to rally them, they were soon driven  back. A number of them were already wounded. They took refuge in  the farm buildings and peeped cautiously out from chinks and  knot-holes. The whole of the big pasture, including the windmill, was  in the hands of the enemy. For the moment even Napoleon seemed at a  loss. He paced up and down without a word, his tail rigid and twitching.  Wistful glances were sent in the direction of Foxwood. If Pilkington  and his men would help them, the day might yet be won. But at this  moment the four pigeons, who had been sent out on the day before,  returned, one of them bearing a scrap of paper from Pilkington. On it  was pencilled the words: \"Serves you right.\"  Meanwhile Frederick and his men had halted about the windmill. The  animals watched them, and a murmur of dismay went round.

52","content":"going to knock the windmill down.  \"Impossible!\" cried Napoleon. \"We have built the walls far too thick for  that. They could not knock it down in a week. Courage, comrades!\"  But Benjamin was watching the movements of the men intently. The  two with the hammer and the crowbar were drilling a hole near the base  of the windmill. Slowly, and with an air almost of amusement,  Benjamin nodded his long muzzle.  \"I thought so,\" he said. \"Do you not see what they are doing? In another  moment they are going to pack blasting powder into that hole.\"  Terrified, the animals waited. It was impossible now to venture out of  the shelter of the buildings. After a few minutes the men were seen to  be running in all directions. Then there was a deafening roar. The  pigeons swirled into the air, and all the animals, except Napoleon, flung  themselves flat on their bellies and hid their faces. When they got up  again, a huge cloud of black smoke was hanging where the windmill  had been. Slowly the breeze drifted it away. The windmill had ceased  to exist!  At this sight the animals' courage returned to them. The fear and  despair they had felt a moment earlier were drowned in their rage  against this vile, contemptible act. A mighty cry for vengeance went up,  and without waiting for further orders they charged forth in a body and  made straight for the enemy. This time they did not heed the cruel  pellets that swept over them like hail. It was a savage, bitter battle. The  men fired again and again, and, when the animals got to close quarters,  lashed out with their sticks and their heavy boots. A cow, three sheep,  and two geese were killed, and nearly everyone was wounded. Even  Napoleon, who was directing operations from the rear, had the tip of his  tail chipped by a pellet. But the men did not go unscathed either. Three  of them had their heads broken by blows from Boxer's hoofs; another  was gored in the belly by a cow's horn; another had his trousers nearly  torn off by Jessie and Bluebell. And when the nine dogs of Napoleon's  own bodyguard, whom he had instructed to make a detour under cover  of the hedge, suddenly appeared on the men's flank, baying ferociously,  panic overtook them. They saw that they were in danger of being  surrounded. Frederick shouted to his men to get out while the going  was good, and the next moment the cowardly enemy was running for  dear life.

But for the first time it occurred to him that  he was eleven years old and that perhaps his great muscles were not  quite what they had once been.  But when the animals saw the green flag flying, and heard the gun  firing again-seven times it was fired in all-and heard the speech that  Napoleon made, congratulating them on their conduct, it did seem to  them after all that they had won a great victory. The animals slain in the  battle were given a solemn funeral. Boxer and Clover pulled the wagon  which served as a hearse, and Napoleon himself walked at the head of  the procession. Two whole days were given over to celebrations. There  were songs, speeches, and more firing of the gun, and a special gift of  an apple was bestowed on every animal, with two ounces of corn for  each bird and three biscuits for each dog. It was announced that the  battle would be called the Battle of the Windmill, and that Napoleon  had created a new decoration, the Order of the Green Banner, which he  had conferred upon himself. In the general rejoicings the unfortunate  affair of the banknotes was forgotten.  It was a few days later than this that the pigs came upon a case of  whisky in the cellars of the farmhouse. It had been overlooked at the  time when the house was first occupied. That night there came from the  farmhouse the sound of loud singing, in which, to everyone's surprise,  the strains of Beasts of England were mixed up. At about half past nine  Napoleon, wearing an old bowler hat of Mr. Jones's, was distinctly seen  to emerge from the back door, gallop rapidly round the yard, and  disappear indoors again. But in the morning a deep silence hung over  the farmhouse. Not a pig appeared to be stirring. It was nearly nine  o'clock when Squealer made his appearance, walking slowly and  dejectedly, his eyes dull, his tail hanging limply behind him, and with  every appearance of being seriously ill. He called the animals together  and told them that he had a terrible piece of news to impart. Comrade  Napoleon was dying!  A cry of lamentation went up. Straw was laid down outside the doors of  the farmhouse, and the animals walked on tiptoe. With tears in their  eyes they asked one another what they should do if their Leader were  taken away from them. A rumour went round that Snowball had after  all contrived to introduce poison into Napoleon's food. At eleven  o'clock Squealer came out to make another announcement.

By the evening of that day Napoleon was  back at work, and on the next day it was learned that he had instructed  Whymper to purchase in Willingdon some booklets on brewing and  distilling. A week later Napoleon gave orders that the small paddock  beyond the orchard, which it had previously been intended to set aside  as a grazing-ground for animals who were past work, was to be  ploughed up. It was given out that the pasture was exhausted and  needed re-seeding; but it soon became known that Napoleon intended  to sow it with barley.  About this time there occurred a strange incident which hardly anyone  was able to understand. One night at about twelve o'clock there was a  loud crash in the yard, and the animals rushed out of their stalls. It was  a moonlit night. At the foot of the end wall of the big barn, where the  Seven Commandments were written, there lay a ladder broken in two  pieces. Squealer, temporarily stunned, was sprawling beside it, and near  at hand there lay a lantern, a paint-brush, and an overturned pot of  white paint. The dogs immediately made a ring round Squealer, and  escorted him back to the farmhouse as soon as he was able to walk.  None of the animals could form any idea as to what this meant, except  old Benjamin, who nodded his muzzle with a knowing air, and seemed  to understand, but would say nothing.  But a few days later Muriel, reading over the Seven Commandments to  herself, noticed that there was yet another of them which the animals  had remembered wrong. They had thought the Fifth Commandment  was \"No animal shall drink alcohol,\" but there were two words that  they had forgotten. Actually the Commandment read: \"No animal shall  drink alcohol to excess.\"  IX  BOXER'S split hoof was a long time in healing.

Clover treated the hoof with poultices of herbs which she prepared by  chewing them, and both she and Benjamin urged Boxer to work less  hard. \"A horse's lungs do not last for ever,\" she said to him. But Boxer  would not listen. He had, he said, only one real ambition left-to see the  windmill well under way before he reached the age for retirement.  At the beginning, when the laws of Animal Farm were first formulated,  the retiring age had been fixed for horses and pigs at twelve, for cows at  fourteen, for dogs at nine, for sheep at seven, and for hens and geese at  five. Liberal old-age pensions had been agreed upon. As yet no animal  had actually retired on pension, but of late the subject had been  discussed more and more. Now that the small field beyond the orchard  had been set aside for barley, it was rumoured that a corner of the large  pasture was to be fenced off and turned into a grazing-ground for  superannuated animals. For a horse, it was said, the pension would be  five pounds of corn a day and, in winter, fifteen pounds of hay, with a  carrot or possibly an apple on public holidays. Boxer's twelfth birthday  was due in the late summer of the following year.  Meanwhile life was hard. The winter was as cold as the last one had  been, and food was even shorter. Once again all rations were reduced,  except those of the pigs and the dogs. A too rigid equality in rations,  Squealer explained, would have been contrary to the principles of  Animalism. In any case he had no difficulty in proving to the other  animals that they were not in reality short of food, whatever the  appearances might be. For the time being, certainly, it had been found  necessary to make a readjustment of rations (Squealer always spoke of  it as a \"readjustment,\" never as a \"reduction\"), but in comparison with  the days of Jones, the improvement was enormous. Reading out the  figures in a shrill, rapid voice, he proved to them in detail that they had  more oats, more hay, more turnips than they had had in Jones's day, that  they worked shorter hours, that their drinking water was of better  quality, that they lived longer, that a larger proportion of their young  ones survived infancy, and that they had more straw in their stalls and  suffered less from fleas. The animals believed every word of it. Truth to  tell, Jones and all he stood for had almost faded out of their memories.  They knew that life nowadays was harsh and bare, that they were often  hungry and often cold, and that they were usually working when they  were not asleep.

57","content":"now they were free, and that made all the difference, as Squealer did  not fail to point out.  There were many more mouths to feed now. In the autumn the four  sows had all littered about simultaneously, producing thirty-one young  pigs between them. The young pigs were piebald, and as Napoleon was  the only boar on the farm, it was possible to guess at their parentage. It  was announced that later, when bricks and timber had been purchased,  a schoolroom would be built in the farmhouse garden. For the time  being, the young pigs were given their instruction by Napoleon himself  in the farmhouse kitchen. They took their exercise in the garden, and  were discouraged from playing with the other young animals. About  this time, too, it was laid down as a rule that when a pig and any other  animal met on the path, the other animal must stand aside: and also that  all pigs, of whatever degree, were to have the privilege of wearing  green ribbons on their tails on Sundays.  The farm had had a fairly successful year, but was still short of money.  There were the bricks, sand, and lime for the schoolroom to be  purchased, and it would also be necessary to begin saving up again for  the machinery for the windmill. Then there were lamp oil and candles  for the house, sugar for Napoleon's own table (he forbade this to the  other pigs, on the ground that it made them fat), and all the usual  replacements such as tools, nails, string, coal, wire, scrap-iron, and dog  biscuits. A stump of hay and part of the potato crop were sold off, and  the contract for eggs was increased to six hundred a week, so that that  year the hens barely hatched enough chicks to keep their numbers at the  same level. Rations, reduced in December, were reduced again in  February, and lanterns in the stalls were forbidden to save Oil. But the  pigs seemed comfortable enough, and in fact were putting on weight if  anything. One afternoon in late February a warm, rich, appetising scent,  such as the animals had never smelt before, wafted itself across the yard  from the little brew-house, which had been disused in Jones's time, and  which stood beyond the kitchen. Someone said it was the smell of  cooking barley. The animals sniffed the air hungrily and wondered  whether a warm mash was being prepared for their supper. But no  warm mash appeared, and on the following Sunday it was announced  that from now onwards all barley would be reserved for the pigs. The  field beyond the orchard had already been sown with barley.

But if there were hardships to be borne, they were partly offset by the  fact that life nowadays had a greater dignity than it had had before.  There were more songs, more speeches, more processions. Napoleon  had commanded that once a week there should be held something  called a Spontaneous Demonstration, the object of which was to  celebrate the struggles and triumphs of Animal Farm. At the appointed  time the animals would leave their work and march round the precincts  of the farm in military formation, with the pigs leading, then the horses,  then the cows, then the sheep, and then the poultry. The dogs flanked  the procession and at the head of all marched Napoleon's black  cockerel. Boxer and Clover always carried between them a green  banner marked with the hoof and the horn and the caption, \"Long live  Comrade Napoleon! \" Afterwards there were recitations of poems  composed in Napoleon's honour, and a speech by Squealer giving  particulars of the latest increases in the production of foodstuffs, and on  occasion a shot was fired from the gun. The sheep were the greatest  devotees of the Spontaneous Demonstration, and if anyone complained  (as a few animals sometimes did, when no pigs or dogs were near) that  they wasted time and meant a lot of standing about in the cold, the  sheep were sure to silence him with a tremendous bleating of \"Four legs  good, two legs bad!\" But by and large the animals enjoyed these  celebrations. They found it comforting to be reminded that, after all,  they were truly their own masters and that the work they did was for  their own benefit. So that, what with the songs, the processions,  Squealer's lists of figures, the thunder of the gun, the crowing of the  cockerel, and the fluttering of the flag, they were able to forget that  their bellies were empty, at least part of the time.  In April, Animal Farm was proclaimed a Republic, and it became  necessary to elect a President. There was only one candidate, Napoleon,  who was elected unanimously. On the same day it was given out that  fresh documents had been discovered which revealed further details  about Snowball's complicity with Jones. It now appeared that Snowball  had not, as the animals had previously imagined, merely attempted to  lose the Battle of the Cowshed by means of a stratagem, but had been  openly fighting on Jones's side. In fact, it was he who had actually been  the leader of the human forces, and had charged into battle with the  words \"Long live Humanity!\" on his lips.

In the middle of the summer Moses the raven suddenly reappeared on  the farm, after an absence of several years. He was quite unchanged,  still did no work, and talked in the same strain as ever about  Sugarcandy Mountain. He would perch on a stump, flap his black  wings, and talk by the hour to anyone who would listen. \"Up there,  comrades,\" he would say solemnly, pointing to the sky with his large  beak-\"up there, just on the other side of that dark cloud that you can  see-there it lies, Sugarcandy Mountain, that happy country where we  poor animals shall rest for ever from our labours!\" He even claimed to  have been there on one of his higher flights, and to have seen the  everlasting fields of clover and the linseed cake and lump sugar  growing on the hedges. Many of the animals believed him. Their lives  now, they reasoned, were hungry and laborious; was it not right and  just that a better world should exist somewhere else? A thing that was  difficult to determine was the attitude of the pigs towards Moses. They  all declared contemptuously that his stories about Sugarcandy  Mountain were lies, and yet they allowed him to remain on the farm,  not working, with an allowance of a gill of beer a day.  After his hoof had healed up, Boxer worked harder than ever. Indeed,  all the animals worked like slaves that year. Apart from the regular  work of the farm, and the rebuilding of the windmill, there was the  schoolhouse for the young pigs, which was started in March.  Sometimes the long hours on insufficient food were hard to bear, but  Boxer never faltered. In nothing that he said or did was there any sign  that his strength was not what it had been. It was only his appearance  that was a little altered; his hide was less shiny than it had used to be,  and his great haunches seemed to have shrunken. The others said,  \"Boxer will pick up when the spring grass comes on\"; but the spring  came and Boxer grew no fatter. Sometimes on the slope leading to the  top of the quarry, when he braced his muscles against the weight of  some vast boulder, it seemed that nothing kept him on his feet except  the will to continue. At such times his lips were seen to form the words,  \"I will work harder\"; he had no voice left. Once again Clover and  Benjamin warned him to take care of his health, but Boxer paid no  attention. His twelfth birthday was approaching. He did not care what  happened so long as a good store of stone was accumulated before he  went on pension.

He had gone out alone to drag a  load of stone down to the windmill. And sure enough, the rumour was  true. A few minutes later two pigeons came racing in with the news:  \"Boxer has fallen! He is lying on his side and can't get up!\"  About half the animals on the farm rushed out to the knoll where the  windmill stood. There lay Boxer, between the shafts of the cart, his  neck stretched out, unable even to raise his head. His eyes were glazed,  his sides matted with sweat. A thin stream of blood had trickled out of  his mouth. Clover dropped to her knees at his side.  \"Boxer!\" she cried, \"how are you?\"  \"It is my lung,\" said Boxer in a weak voice. \"It does not matter. I think  you will be able to finish the windmill without me. There is a pretty  good store of stone accumulated. I had only another month to go in any  case. To tell you the truth, I had been looking forward to my retirement.  And perhaps, as Benjamin is growing old too, they will let him retire at  the same time and be a companion to me.\"  \"We must get help at once,\" said Clover. \"Run, somebody, and tell  Squealer what has happened.\"  All the other animals immediately raced back to the farmhouse to give  Squealer the news. Only Clover remained, and Benjamin7 who lay  down at Boxer's side, and, without speaking, kept the flies off him with  his long tail. After about a quarter of an hour Squealer appeared, full of  sympathy and concern. He said that Comrade Napoleon had learned  with the very deepest distress of this misfortune to one of the most  loyal workers on the farm, and was already making arrangements to  send Boxer to be treated in the hospital at Willingdon. The animals felt  a little uneasy at this. Except for Mollie and Snowball, no other animal  had ever left the farm, and they did not like to think of their sick  comrade in the hands of human beings. However, Squealer easily  convinced them that the veterinary surgeon in Willingdon could treat  Boxer's case more satisfactorily than could be done on the farm. And  about half an hour later, when Boxer had somewhat recovered, he was  with difficulty got on to his feet, and managed to limp back to his stall,  where Clover and Benjamin had prepared a good bed of straw for him.  For the next two days Boxer remained in his stall.

In the evenings she lay in his stall and talked to him, while  Benjamin kept the flies off him. Boxer professed not to be sorry for  what had happened. If he made a good recovery, he might expect to live  another three years, and he looked forward to the peaceful days that he  would spend in the corner of the big pasture. It would be the first time  that he had had leisure to study and improve his mind. He intended, he  said, to devote the rest of his life to learning the remaining twenty-two  letters of the alphabet.  However, Benjamin and Clover could only be with Boxer after working  hours, and it was in the middle of the day when the van came to take  him away. The animals were all at work weeding turnips under the  supervision of a pig, when they were astonished to see Benjamin come  galloping from the direction of the farm buildings, braying at the top of  his voice. It was the first time that they had ever seen Benjamin  excited-indeed, it was the first time that anyone had ever seen him  gallop. \"Quick, quick!\" he shouted. \"Come at once! They're taking  Boxer away!\" Without waiting for orders from the pig, the animals  broke off work and raced back to the farm buildings. Sure enough,  there in the yard was a large closed van, drawn by two horses, with  lettering on its side and a sly-looking man in a low-crowned bowler hat  sitting on the driver's seat. And Boxer's stall was empty.  The animals crowded round the van. \"Good-bye, Boxer!\" they  chorused, \"good-bye!\"  \"Fools! Fools!\" shouted Benjamin, prancing round them and stamping  the earth with his small hoofs. \"Fools! Do you not see what is written  on the side of that van?\"  That gave the animals pause, and there was a hush. Muriel began to  spell out the words. But Benjamin pushed her aside and in the midst of  a deadly silence he read:  \" 'Alfred Simmonds, Horse Slaughterer and Glue Boiler, Willingdon.  Dealer in Hides and Bone-Meal. Kennels Supplied.' Do you not  understand what that means? They are taking Boxer to the knacker's! \"  A cry of horror burst from all the animals. At this moment the man on  the box whipped up his horses and the van moved out of the yard at a  smart trot. All the animals followed, crying out at the tops of their  voices. Clover forced her way to the front. The van began to gather  speed.

Boxer! Boxer!\" And just at this  moment, as though he had heard the uproar outside, Boxer's face, with  the white stripe down his nose, appeared at the small window at the  back of the van.  \"Boxer!\" cried Clover in a terrible voice. \"Boxer! Get out! Get out  quickly! They're taking you to your death!\"  All the animals took up the cry of \"Get out, Boxer, get out!\" But the  van was already gathering speed and drawing away from them. It was  uncertain whether Boxer had understood what Clover had said. But a  moment later his face disappeared from the window and there was the  sound of a tremendous drumming of hoofs inside the van. He was  trying to kick his way out. The time had been when a few kicks from  Boxer's hoofs would have smashed the van to matchwood. But alas! his  strength had left him; and in a few moments the sound of drumming  hoofs grew fainter and died away. In desperation the animals began  appealing to the two horses which drew the van to stop. \"Comrades,  comrades!\" they shouted. \"Don't take your own brother to his death! \"  But the stupid brutes, too ignorant to realise what was happening,  merely set back their ears and quickened their pace. Boxer's face did  not reappear at the window. Too late, someone thought of racing ahead  and shutting the five-barred gate; but in another moment the van was  through it and rapidly disappearing down the road. Boxer was never  seen again.  Three days later it was announced that he had died in the hospital at  Willingdon, in spite of receiving every attention a horse could have.  Squealer came to announce the news to the others. He had, he said,  been present during Boxer's last hours.  \"It was the most affecting sight I have ever seen!\" said Squealer, lifting  his trotter and wiping away a tear. \"I was at his bedside at the very last.  And at the end, almost too weak to speak, he whispered in my ear that  his sole sorrow was to have passed on before the windmill was finished.  'Forward, comrades!' he whispered. 'Forward in the name of the  Rebellion. Long live Animal Farm! Long live Comrade Napoleon!  Napoleon is always right.' Those were his very last words, comrades.\"  Here Squealer's demeanour suddenly changed.

Some of the animals  had noticed that the van which took Boxer away was marked \"Horse  Slaughterer,\" and had actually jumped to the conclusion that Boxer was  being sent to the knacker's. It was almost unbelievable, said Squealer,  that any animal could be so stupid. Surely, he cried indignantly,  whisking his tail and skipping from side to side, surely they knew their  beloved Leader, Comrade Napoleon, better than that? But the  explanation was really very simple. The van had previously been the  property of the knacker, and had been bought by the veterinary surgeon,  who had not yet painted the old name out. That was how the mistake  had arisen.  The animals were enormously relieved to hear this. And when Squealer  went on to give further graphic details of Boxer's death-bed, the  admirable care he had received, and the expensive medicines for which  Napoleon had paid without a thought as to the cost, their last doubts  disappeared and the sorrow that they felt for their comrade's death was  tempered by the thought that at least he had died happy.  Napoleon himself appeared at the meeting on the following Sunday  morning and pronounced a short oration in Boxer's honour. It had not  been possible, he said, to bring back their lamented comrade's remains  for interment on the farm, but he had ordered a large wreath to be made  from the laurels in the farmhouse garden and sent down to be placed on  Boxer's grave. And in a few days' time the pigs intended to hold a  memorial banquet in Boxer's honour. Napoleon ended his speech with a  reminder of Boxer's two favourite maxims, \"I will work harder\" and  \"Comrade Napoleon is always right\"-maxims, he said, which every  animal would do well to adopt as his own.  On the day appointed for the banquet, a grocer's van drove up from  Willingdon and delivered a large wooden crate at the farmhouse. That  night there was the sound of uproarious singing, which was followed by  what sounded like a violent quarrel and ended at about eleven o'clock  with a tremendous crash of glass.

64","content":"X  YEARS passed. The seasons came and went, the short animal lives fled  by. A time came when there was no one who remembered the old days  before the Rebellion, except Clover, Benjamin, Moses the raven, and a  number of the pigs.  Muriel was dead; Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher were dead. Jones too  was dead-he had died in an inebriates' home in another part of the  country. Snowball was forgotten. Boxer was forgotten, except by the  few who had known him. Clover was an old stout mare now, stiff in the  joints and with a tendency to rheumy eyes. She was two years past the  retiring age, but in fact no animal had ever actually retired. The talk of  setting aside a corner of the pasture for superannuated animals had long  since been dropped. Napoleon was now a mature boar of twenty-four  stone. Squealer was so fat that he could with difficulty see out of his  eyes. Only old Benjamin was much the same as ever, except for being a  little greyer about the muzzle, and, since Boxer's death, more morose  and taciturn than ever.  There were many more creatures on the farm now, though the increase  was not so great as had been expected in earlier years. Many animals  had been born to whom the Rebellion was only a dim tradition, passed  on by word of mouth, and others had been bought who had never heard  mention of such a thing before their arrival. The farm possessed three  horses now besides Clover. They were fine upstanding beasts, willing  workers and good comrades, but very stupid. None of them proved able  to learn the alphabet beyond the letter B. They accepted everything that  they were told about the Rebellion and the principles of Animalism,  especially from Clover, for whom they had an almost filial respect; but  it was doubtful whether they understood very much of it.  The farm was more prosperous now, and better organised: it had even  been enlarged by two fields which had been bought from Mr.  Pilkington. The windmill had been successfully completed at last, and  the farm possessed a threshing machine and a hay elevator of its own,  and various new buildings had been added to it. Whymper had bought  himself a dogcart. The windmill, however, had not after all been used  for generating electrical power. It was used for milling corn, and  brought in a handsome money profit.

But the luxuries of which  Snowball had once taught the animals to dream, the stalls with electric  light and hot and cold water, and the three-day week, were no longer  talked about. Napoleon had denounced such ideas as contrary to the  spirit of Animalism. The truest happiness, he said, lay in working hard  and living frugally.  Somehow it seemed as though the farm had grown richer without  making the animals themselves any richer-except, of course, for the  pigs and the dogs. Perhaps this was partly because there were so many  pigs and so many dogs. It was not that these creatures did not work,  after their fashion. There was, as Squealer was never tired of  explaining, endless work in the supervision and organisation of the  farm. Much of this work was of a kind that the other animals were too  ignorant to understand. For example, Squealer told them that the pigs  had to expend enormous labours every day upon mysterious things  called \"files,\" \"reports,\" \"minutes,\" and \"memoranda.\" These were large  sheets of paper which had to be closely covered with writing, and as  soon as they were so covered, they were burnt in the furnace. This was  of the highest importance for the welfare of the farm, Squealer said. But  still, neither pigs nor dogs produced any food by their own labour; and  there were very many of them, and their appetites were always good.  As for the others, their life, so far as they knew, was as it had always  been. They were generally hungry, they slept on straw, they drank from  the pool, they laboured in the fields; in winter they were troubled by the  cold, and in summer by the flies. Sometimes the older ones among  them racked their dim memories and tried to determine whether in the  early days of the Rebellion, when Jones's expulsion was still recent,  things had been better or worse than now. They could not remember.  There was nothing with which they could compare their present lives:  they had nothing to go upon except Squealer's lists of figures, which  invariably demonstrated that everything was getting better and better.  The animals found the problem insoluble; in any case, they had little  time for speculating on such things now. Only old Benjamin professed  to remember every detail of his long life and to know that things never  had been, nor ever could be much better or much worse-hunger,  hardship, and disappointment being, so he said, the unalterable law of  life.

66","content":"Animal Farm. They were still the only farm in the whole county-in all  England!-owned and operated by animals. Not one of them, not even  the youngest, not even the newcomers who had been brought from  farms ten or twenty miles away, ever ceased to marvel at that. And  when they heard the gun booming and saw the green flag fluttering at  the masthead, their hearts swelled with imperishable pride, and the talk  turned always towards the old heroic days, the expulsion of Jones, the  writing of the Seven Commandments, the great battles in which the  human invaders had been defeated. None of the old dreams had been  abandoned. The Republic of the Animals which Major had foretold,  when the green fields of England should be untrodden by human feet,  was still believed in. Some day it was coming: it might not be soon, it  might not be with in the lifetime of any animal now living, but still it  was coming. Even the tune of Beasts of England was perhaps hummed  secretly here and there: at any rate, it was a fact that every animal on  the farm knew it, though no one would have dared to sing it aloud. It  might be that their lives were hard and that not all of their hopes had  been fulfilled; but they were conscious that they were not as other  animals. If they went hungry, it was not from feeding tyrannical human  beings; if they worked hard, at least they worked for themselves. No  creature among them went upon two legs. No creature called any other  creature \"Master.\" All animals were equal.  One day in early summer Squealer ordered the sheep to follow him, and  led them out to a piece of waste ground at the other end of the farm,  which had become overgrown with birch saplings. The sheep spent the  whole day there browsing at the leaves under Squealer's supervision. In  the evening he returned to the farmhouse himself, but, as it was warm  weather, told the sheep to stay where they were. It ended by their  remaining there for a whole week, during which time the other animals  saw nothing of them. Squealer was with them for the greater part of  every day. He was, he said, teaching them to sing a new song, for  which privacy was needed.  It was just after the sheep had returned, on a pleasant evening when the  animals had finished work and were making their way back to the farm  buildings, that the terrified neighing of a horse sounded from the yard.  Startled, the animals stopped in their tracks. It was Clover's voice. She  neighed again, and all the animals broke into a gallop and rushed into  the yard. Then they saw what Clover had seen.

67","content":"Yes, it was Squealer. A little awkwardly, as though not quite used to  supporting his considerable bulk in that position, but with perfect  balance, he was strolling across the yard. And a moment later, out from  the door of the farmhouse came a long file of pigs, all walking on their  hind legs. Some did it better than others, one or two were even a trifle  unsteady and looked as though they would have liked the support of a  stick, but every one of them made his way right round the yard  successfully. And finally there was a tremendous baying of dogs and a  shrill crowing from the black cockerel, and out came Napoleon himself,  majestically upright, casting haughty glances from side to side, and  with his dogs gambolling round him.  He carried a whip in his trotter.  There was a deadly silence. Amazed, terrified, huddling together, the  animals watched the long line of pigs march slowly round the yard. It  was as though the world had turned upside-down. Then there came a  moment when the first shock had worn off and when, in spite of  everything-in spite of their terror of the dogs, and of the habit,  developed through long years, of never complaining, never criticising,  no matter what happened-they might have uttered some word of protest.  But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out  into a tremendous bleating of-  \"Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four  legs good, two legs better!\"  It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep  had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the  pigs had marched back into the farmhouse.  Benjamin felt a nose nuzzling at his shoulder. He looked round. It was  Clover. Her old eyes looked dimmer than ever. Without saying  anything, she tugged gently at his mane and led him round to the end of  the big barn, where the Seven Commandments were written. For a  minute or two they stood gazing at the tatted wall with its white  lettering.  \"My sight is failing,\" she said finally. \"Even when I was young I could  not have read what was written there. But it appears to me that that wall  looks different.

There was nothing there now except a  single Commandment. It ran:  ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL  BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL  THAN OTHERS  After that it did not seem strange when next day the pigs who were  supervising the work of the farm all carried whips in their trotters. It did  not seem strange to learn that the pigs had bought themselves a wireless  set, were arranging to install a telephone, and had taken out  subscriptions to John Bull, TitBits, and the Daily Mirror. It did not  seem strange when Napoleon was seen strolling in the farmhouse  garden with a pipe in his mouth-no, not even when the pigs took Mr.  Jones's clothes out of the wardrobes and put them on, Napoleon himself  appearing in a black coat, ratcatcher breeches, and leather leggings,  while his favourite sow appeared in the watered silk dress which Mrs.  Jones had been used to wear on Sundays.  A week later, in the afternoon, a number of dogcarts drove up to the  farm. A deputation of neighbouring farmers had been invited to make a  tour of inspection. They were shown all over the farm, and expressed  great admiration for everything they saw, especially the windmill. The  animals were weeding the turnip field. They worked diligently hardly  raising their faces from the ground, and not knowing whether to be  more frightened of the pigs or of the human visitors.  That evening loud laughter and bursts of singing came from the  farmhouse. And suddenly, at the sound of the mingled voices, the  animals were stricken with curiosity. What could be happening in there,  now that for the first time animals and human beings were meeting on  terms of equality? With one accord they began to creep as quietly as  possible into the farmhouse garden.  At the gate they paused, half frightened to go on but Clover led the way  in. They tiptoed up to the house, and such animals as were tall enough  peered in at the dining-room window.

69","content":"The pigs appeared completely at ease in their chairs The company had  been enjoying a game of cards but had broken off for the moment,  evidently in order to drink a toast. A large jug was circulating, and the  mugs were being refilled with beer. No one noticed the wondering  faces of the animals that gazed in at the window.  Mr. Pilkington, of Foxwood, had stood up, his mug in his hand. In a  moment, he said, he would ask the present company to drink a toast.  But before doing so, there were a few words that he felt it incumbent  upon him to say.  It was a source of great satisfaction to him, he said-and, he was sure, to  all others present-to feel that a long period of mistrust and  misunderstanding had now come to an end. There had been a time-not  that he, or any of the present company, had shared such sentiments-but  there had been a time when the respected proprietors of Animal Farm  had been regarded, he would not say with hostility, but perhaps with a  certain measure of misgiving, by their human neighbours. Unfortunate  incidents had occurred, mistaken ideas had been current. It had been  felt that the existence of a farm owned and operated by pigs was  somehow abnormal and was liable to have an unsettling effect in the  neighbourhood. Too many farmers had assumed, without due enquiry,  that on such a farm a spirit of licence and indiscipline would prevail.  They had been nervous about the effects upon their own animals, or  even upon their human employees. But all such doubts were now  dispelled. Today he and his friends had visited Animal Farm and  inspected every inch of it with their own eyes, and what did they find?  Not only the most up-to-date methods, but a discipline and an  orderliness which should be an example to all farmers everywhere. He  believed that he was right in saying that the lower animals on Animal  Farm did more work and received less food than any animals in the  county. Indeed, he and his fellow-visitors today had observed many  features which they intended to introduce on their own farms  immediately.  He would end his remarks, he said, by emphasising once again the  friendly feelings that subsisted, and ought to subsist, between Animal  Farm and its neighbours. Between pigs and human beings there was  not, and there need not be, any clash of interests whatever. Their  struggles and their difficulties were one. Was not the labour problem  the same everywhere?

After much choking, during which his various chins turned purple, he  managed to get it out: \"If you have your lower animals to contend  with,\" he said, \"we have our lower classes!\" This bon mot set the table  in a roar; and Mr. Pilkington once again congratulated the pigs on the  low rations, the long working hours, and the general absence of  pampering which he had observed on Animal Farm.  And now, he said finally, he would ask the company to rise to their feet  and make certain that their glasses were full. \"Gentlemen,\" concluded  Mr. Pilkington, \"gentlemen, I give you a toast: To the prosperity of  Animal Farm!\"  There was enthusiastic cheering and stamping of feet. Napoleon was so  gratified that he left his place and came round the table to clink his mug  against Mr. Pilkington's before emptying it. When the cheering had  died down, Napoleon, who had remained on his feet, intimated that he  too had a few words to say.  Like all of Napoleon's speeches, it was short and to the point. He too,  he said, was happy that the period of misunderstanding was at an end.  For a long time there had been rumours-circulated, he had reason to  think, by some malignant enemy-that there was something subversive  and even revolutionary in the outlook of himself and his colleagues.  They had been credited with attempting to stir up rebellion among the  animals on neighbouring farms. Nothing could be further from the  truth! Their sole wish, now and in the past, was to live at peace and in  normal business relations with their neighbours. This farm which he  had the honour to control, he added, was a co-operative enterprise. The  title-deeds, which were in his own possession, were owned by the pigs  jointly.  He did not believe, he said, that any of the old suspicions still lingered,  but certain changes had been made recently in the routine of the farm  which should have the effect of promoting confidence stiff further.  Hitherto the animals on the farm had had a rather foolish custom of  addressing one another as \"Comrade.\" This was to be suppressed. There  had also been a very strange custom, whose origin was unknown, of  marching every Sunday morning past a boar's skull which was nailed to  a post in the garden.

It would be a plain green flag from  now onwards.  He had only one criticism, he said, to make of Mr. Pilkington's  excellent and neighbourly speech. Mr. Pilkington had referred  throughout to \"Animal Farm.\" He could not of course know-for he,  Napoleon, was only now for the first time announcing it-that the name  \"Animal Farm\" had been abolished. Henceforward the farm was to be  known as \"The Manor Farm\"-which, he believed, was its correct and  original name.  \"Gentlemen,\" concluded Napoleon, \"I will give you the same toast as  before, but in a different form. Fill your glasses to the brim. Gentlemen,  here is my toast: To the prosperity of The Manor Farm! \"  There was the same hearty cheering as before, and the mugs were  emptied to the dregs. But as the animals outside gazed at the scene, it  seemed to them that some strange thing was happening. What was it  that had altered in the faces of the pigs? Clover's old dim eyes flitted  from one face to another. Some of them had five chins, some had four,  some had three. But what was it that seemed to be melting and  changing? Then, the applause having come to an end, the company took  up their cards and continued the game that had been interrupted, and the  animals crept silently away.  But they had not gone twenty yards when they stopped short. An uproar  of voices was coming from the farmhouse. They rushed back and  looked through the window again. Yes, a violent quarrel was in  progress. There were shoutings, bangings on the table, sharp suspicious  glances, furious denials. The source of the trouble appeared to be that  Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington had each played an ace of spades  simultaneously.  Twelve voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike. No  question, now, what had happened to the faces of the pigs. The  creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and  from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was  which.
